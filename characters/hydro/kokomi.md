| With Recovery | ~ | 122 | 141.8%/s | ~ |

* Kokomi's Normal Attacks...
  * Apply hydro and share a 3 hit / 2.5s ICD.
  * Have a range of ~6 tiles before it stops auto-targetting.
  * Hit in a small AoE.
* Kokomi's 2nd Normal Attack sometimes has a delay before it comes out. This delay is inconsistent, but can usually be mitigated by performing Dash or Jump cancel.

**Charged Attack**  
Consumes 50 Stamina to deal AoE Hydro DMG after a short casting time.

| String | Talent 9% | Frames | MV/s | GU |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Charged Attack DMG | 252.14% | 45 | 336.19% | 1A |

* Kokomi's Charged Attack applies hydro and has no ICD.

**Plunge Attack**  
Gathering the might of Hydro, Kokomi plunges towards the ground from mid-air, damaging all opponents in her path. Deals AoE Hydro DMG upon impact with the ground.

| Type | Talent 9% | GU |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Plunge DMG | 104.41% | ~ |
| Low Plunge DMG | 208.77% | 1A |
| High Plunge DMG | 260.76% | 1A |

* Kokomi's Low/High Plunge Attacks apply hydro and have no ICD.

{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Kurage&apos;s Oath" %}
Summons a **"bake-kurage"** created from water that can heal her allies. Using this skill will apply the Wet status to Sangonomiya Kokomi. 

**Bake-Kurage**  
Deals Hydro DMG to surrounding opponents and heal nearby active characters once every 2s. This healing is based on Kokomi's Max HP.

| Attribute | Skill |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ripple DMG \(T9%\) | 185.62% |
| Particles | 0~1 (1:2) |
| Frames | 66 (51 with Dash Cancel) |
| GU | 1A |
| ICD | None |
| Snapshot | Snapshot |
| Damage Element | Hydro |
| Damage Type | Skill |
| HP Regen \(T9%\) | 7.48% Max HP + 862 |
| Duration | 12s |
| Tick Rate | 2s |
| Cooldown | 20s |

**Notes**
* Does a 0~1 (1:2) check once on every instance of damage **Bake-Kurage** does as long as it stays on the field.
  * If **Bake-Kurage** disappears before its final tick hits an enemy, the game will not check for particle production on that hit.
* **Bake-Kurage**'s range has a radius of ~2.5 tiles.
* Kokomi is limited to one **Bake-Kurage** on-field at a time.
* **Bake-Kurage** snapshots on **Kurage's Oath** cast and gets resnapshot upon **Nereid's Ascension** procing the duration refresh effect from her Ascension 1.
* In most cases, the damage bonus from **Ceremonial Garment** is a dynamic stat and thus does not get snapshot by **Bake-Kurage**. However, if Kokomi immediately switches after casting **Kurage's Oath**, the damage bonus from **Ceremonial Garment** is snapshot by **Bake-Kurage**.
* Casting **Kurage's Oath**, even when interrupted, will still trigger Artifact set effects that trigger on Elemental Skill cast.
* Tech: It is possible to snapshot the damage bonus from **Nereid's Ascension** for **Bake-Kurage** by casting E, being in Q, and swapping off before the first tick of the E. Using a simple application of this, it is possible to maintain 100% uptime on the Q bonus for E just by timing your rotations.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Nereid&apos;s Ascension" %}
The might of Watatsumi descends, dealing Hydro DMG to surrounding opponents, before robing Kokomi in a **Ceremonial Garment** made from the flowing waters of Sangonomiya. 

**Ceremonial Garment**  
• Sangonomiya Kokomi's Normal Attack, Charged Attack and **Bake-Kurage** DMG are increased based on her Max HP.  
• When her Normal and Charged Attacks hit opponents, Kokomi will restore HP for all nearby party members, and the amount restored is based on her Max HP.  
• Increases Sangonomiya Kokomi's resistance to interruption and allows her to move on the water's surface.

These effects will be cleared once Sangonomiya Kokomi leaves the field.
