{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Illusory Torrent" %}
**Alternate Sprint**

* Her alternate sprint has the same iframes as other characters' normal sprint.

| **Effect** | **Values** |
| :--- | :--- |

| Stamina Drain | 15/s |
| Hydro Application GU | 1A |

* **Illusory Torrent** isn't affected by stamina reduction passives from Kaeya or Razor
* **Illusory Torrent** holds priority over Mona's skill, meaning that if you dash before Mona's skill is finished casting, the skill cast will be cancelled and Mona will dash instead.
* Rosaria's Passive, **Night Walk**, increases Mona's sprint speed
  * the same goes for Anemo Resonance

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Stellaris Phantasm" %}
Mona summons the sparkling waves creating a reflection of the starry sky, applying the **Illusory Bubble** status to opponents in a large AoE.

**Illusory Bubble**  
Traps opponents inside a pocket of destiny and also makes them Wet. Renders weaker opponents immobile. When an opponent affected by **Illusory Bubble** sustains DMG, it has the following effects:

* Applies an **Omen** to the opponent, which gives a DMG Bonus, also increasing the DMG of the attack that causes it.
* Removes the **Illusory Bubble** dealing Hydro DMG in the process.

| **Effect** | **Talent 6%** | **GU** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bubble Duration | 8s | 1A |
| Bubble DMG | 619.39% | 2B |
| Omen DMG Bonus | 52% \(scaling\) | ~ |
| Omen Duration | 4.5s | ~ |
| CD | 15s | ~ |
| Energy Cost | 60 | ~ |
| Frames | 125 | ~ |

* Bubble Burst DMG is determined at the time the Bubble is actually triggered, rather than snapshotting on immediate cast.
* **Omen** DMG Bonus is additive to the damage calculation and is classified as **DamageBonus**
  * See: [Damage Formula](https://library.keqingmains.com/mechanics/combat/damage-formula#base-damage)
* **Illusory Bubble**'s duration can be extended under specific circumstances:
  * Enemies that were applied Cryo beforehand, thus got Frozen after receiving the **Illusory Bubble** status.
  * Enemies that are in a stagger-resistant state, i.e., performing an attack animation, having an elemental shield/armor, etc.
* Certain skill/bursts cannot trigger the **Illusory Bubble** (Zhongli E, Klee Q).

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Passive" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 1" %}
## **“Come ‘n’ Get me, Hag!”**

After she has used **Illusory Torrent** for 2s, if there are any opponents nearby, Mona will automatically create a **Phantom**:

* A **Phantom** created in this manner lasts for 2s, and its explosion DMG is equal to 50% of **Mirror Reflection of Doom**.
* Damage dealt by this **Phantom** is considered elemental skill damage, and can thus trigger related artifact effects.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 4" %}
## Waterborne Destiny

Increases Mona’s Hydro DMG Bonus by a degree equivalent to 20% of her Energy Recharge rate.

* The Hydro DMG Bonus increase only shows when Mona is in an active party.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C2" %}
## **Lunar Chain**

When a **Normal Attack** hits, there is a 20% chance that it will be automatically followed by a **Charged Attack**. This effect can only occur once every 5s.

{% endtab %}
