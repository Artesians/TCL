* Recovery of 6th Hit is 53 Frames.
* MV/s stated is without recovery and assumes a standing combat-neutral startup. 

**Charged Attack**  
Perform a more precise Aimed Shot with increased DMG.
While aiming, the power of Hydro will accumulate on the arrowhead. A arrow fully charged with the torrent will deal Hydro DMG and apply the **Riptide** status.

**Riptide**  
Opponents affected by Riptide will suffer from AoE Hydro DMG effects when attacked by Tartaglia in various ways. DMG dealt in this way is considered Normal Attack DMG.  
• **Riptide Flash**: A fully-charged Aimed Shot that hits an opponent affected by Riptide deals consecutive bouts of AoE DMG. Can occur once every 0.7s.  
• **Riptide Burst**: Defeating an opponent affected by Riptide creates a Hydro burst that inflicts the Riptide status on nearby opponents hit.

* Both **Riptide Flash** and **Riptide Burst** do not snapshot.

**Plunge Attack**  
Fires off a shower of arrows in mid-air before falling and striking the ground, dealing AOE DMG.  
When Tartaglia is in Foul Legacy: Raging Tide’s **Melee Stance**, he cannot perform a plunge attack.

| Damage Type | Talent 9% | Poise Damage | Impulse Type |

In this Stance, Tartaglia's Normal and Charged Attacks are converted to Hydro DMG that cannot be overridden by any other elemental infusion and change as follows:

**Normal Attack**  
Perform up to 6 consecutive Hydro strikes.

Consume 20 Stamina to unleash a cross slash, dealing Hydro DMG.

| N3C | 494.23% | 125 | 237.23%/s | 1A | - | - |

* All frame counts are done against a Ruin Guard.

**Riptide Slash**  
Hitting an opponent affected by **Riptide** with a melee attack unleashes a **Riptide Slash** that deals AoE Hydro DMG. DMG dealt in this way is considered Elemental Skill DMG, and can only occur once every 1.5s.

After 30s, or when the ability is unleashed again, this skill will end. Tartaglia will return to his Ranged Stance and this ability will enter CD. The longer Tartaglia stays in his Melee Stance, the longer the CD.

If the return to a ranged stance occurs automatically after 30s, the CD is even longer.

**Notes**
* Gives 1 Hydro Particle upon proc. However, this particle generation has an ICD of 3 seconds.
* **Riptide** and **Riptide Slash** can be applied and triggered by Aimed Shot, both Physical and Hydro, by switching to melee stance before the arrow hits an enemy.  
* Using this skill in quick succession after a partial **Bow Stance** attack string allows Childe to continue the attack string in **Melee Stance**. 
* Using this skill on the same frame as an attack or burst input can result in a **Ranged Burst** while in **Melee Stance**, a **Melee N1** in **Ranged Stance**,[ among other effects.](../../evidence/characters/hydro/tartaglia.md#elemental-skill-and-attack-or-burst-on-the-same-frame) 
* Preemptive CD scales discretely, floored to an integer before cooldown reduction calculations.
