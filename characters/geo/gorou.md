{% tab title="Inuzaka All-Round Defense" %}  
Deals AoE Geo DMG and sets up a **General's War Banner**.  

**General's War Banner**  
Provides up to 3 buffs to active characters within the skill's AoE based on the number of Geo characters in the party at the time of casting:  
* 1 Geo character: Adds "**Standing Firm**" - DEF Bonus.  
* 2 Geo characters: Adds "**Impregnable**" - Increased resistance to interruption.  
* 3 Geo characters: Adds "**Crunch**" - Geo DMG Bonus.

Gorou can deploy only 1 **General's War Banner** on the field at any one time. Characters can only benefit from 1 **General's War Banner** at a time. When a party member leaves the field, the active buff will last for 2s.

**Hold**  
Adjust the location of the skill.

**Notes**
* Gorou counts as one of the Geo characters for **General's War Banner**'s buff condition.
* The inital hit of **Inuzaka All-Round Defense** does not benefit from its own buff.
* There is a delay before applying the buff effects of **General's War Banner**.
* The **General's War Banner** is not affected by gravity. 

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Juuga: Forward Unto Victory" %}
Displaying his valor as a general, Gorou deals AoE Geo DMG and creates a field known as General's Glory to embolden his comrades.

**General's Glory**  
This field has the following properties:  
* Like the **General's War Banner** created by **Inuzaka All-Round Defense**, provides buffs to active characters within the skill's AoE based on the number of Geo characters in the party. Also moves together with your active character.  
* Generates 1 **Crystal Collapse** every 1.5s that deals AoE Geo DMG to 1 opponent within the skill's AoE.  
* Pulls 1 elemental shard in the skill's AoE to your active character's position every 1.5s (elemental shards are created by Crystallize reactions).

If a **General's War Banner** created by Gorou currently exists on the field when this ability is used, it will be destroyed. In addition, for the duration of **General's Glory**, Gorou's Elemental Skill "**Inuzaka All-Round Defense**" will not create the **General's War Banner**.  
If Gorou falls, the effects of **General's Glory** will be cleared.

{% tab title="C2" %}
