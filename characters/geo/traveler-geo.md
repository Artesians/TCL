## **Attacks**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Favonious Bladework - Maid" %}
**Normal Attacks**  
Perform up to 4 consecutive strikes.

| String | Talent 6% | Frames | Motion Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-Hit | 115% |  |  |
| 2-Hit | 106.63% |  |  |
| 3-Hit | 125.38% |  |  |
| 4-Hit | 164.88% |  |  |

Optimal damage is a 4-hit cancel when hitting all targets or 3-hit cancel when the fourth hit won't hit all enemies.

**Charged Attack**  
Noelle consumes 40 stamina a second to keep spinning. _\*\*_ At the end, perform a more powerful slash.

| String | Talent 6% | Frames | Motion Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Spin | 73.75% |  |  |
| Final hit | 131.5% |  |  |

Enemies struck by Noelle's charged attack will be staggered or launched.

**Plunge**

| Damage Type | Talent 6% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Plunge Impact | 108.41% |
| Low Plunge DMG | 216.78% |
| High Plunge DMG | 270.77% |

If performing a Jump when breastplate expires Noelle can gain enough height to use a plunge attack.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Breastplate" %}
Summon a shield that deals damage in a small radius around Noelle.

* Shield strength scales with Noelle’s current Def.
* When hitting an enemy there is a chance to heal all characters in the party. 
* The amount healed scales with Noelle’s current Def.
* The Shield possesses the following properties:
  * 150% DMG Absorption Efficiency against all damage.
  * Can trigger Crystallize when hitting a target with a element applied to them.

| Type | Talent 6% | Cooldown | GU | Frames | Motion Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Base DMG | 168%Def | 24 sec |  |  |  |
| Healing | 29.79%Def + 163 |  |  |  |  |
| Healing chance | 55% |  |  |  |  |
| Shield Scaling | 224%Def + 1219 |  |  |  |  |
| Duration | 12 sec |  |  |  |  |

* The shield damage from C4 is calculated using Noelle’s current attack at the moment the shield breaks.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Sweeping Time" %}
Noelle infuses her sword with Geo energy greatly increasing the range of her normal attacks.

* Converts her normal attacks from Physical to Geo, this infusion cannot be overridden by other sources.
* Converts Noelle’s current total Def into Atk at a rate decided by talent level.
* The skill and burst damage values apply to the first two hits in the animation when activating burst.

| Effect | Talent 6% / Data |
| :--- | :--- |
| Elemental burst DMG | 94.08% |
| Skill DMG | 129.92% |
| Def conversion | 56% DEF |
| Duration | 15s |
| Cooldown | 15s \(non-scaling\) |
| Energy Cost | 60 |
| Frames |  |

* The bonus Def conversion from C6 is additive i.e. it takes the bonus from 56% to 106% at talent level 6.
* The Def to Atk conversion is snapshotted when you activate burst so any changes to Def after burst is used will not increase Atk.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## **Ascension Passives**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Passive" %}
### Maid’s Knighthood

* When a Perfect Cooking is achieved on a DEF-boosting dish, Noelle has a 12% chance to obtain double the product.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 2" %}
### Devotion

When Noelle is in the party but not on field, this ability triggers automatically when you active character’s HP falls below 30%.

* Creates a shield for you active character that lasts 20s and absorbs DMG equal to 400% of Noelle’s DEF.
* This shield  has a 150% DMG absorption effectiveness against all damage.
* This effect can only occur once every 60s.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 4" %}
### Nice and clean

Every 4 normal attack or Charged Attack hits will decrease the CD of Breastplate by 1s.

* Hitting multiple opponents with a single attack is only counted as one hit.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
