## **Attacks**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Favonious Bladework - Maid" %}
**Normal Attacks**  
Perform up to 4 consecutive strikes.

| String | Talent 6% | Frames | Motion Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-Hit | 115% | 28 | 246%/s |
| 2-Hit | 106.63% | 70 | 189%/s |
| 3-Hit | 125.38% | 116 | 179%/s |
| 4-Hit | 164.88% | 174 | 176%/s |

Optimal damage is a 4-hit cancel when hitting all targets or 3-hit cancel when the fourth hit won't hit all enemies.

**Charged Attack**  
Noelle consumes 40 stamina a second to keep spinning. At the end, perform a more powerful slash.

| String | Talent 6% | Frames | Motion Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Spin | 73.75% | 311 | 142%/s |
| Final hit | 131.5% | 40 | 148%/s |

Enemies struck by Noelle's charged attack will be staggered or launched.

**Plunge**

| Damage Type | Talent 6% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Plunge Impact | 108.41% |
| Low Plunge DMG | 216.78% |
| High Plunge DMG | 270.77% |

Noelle is able to perform dragonstrike, but because of her model, it's difficult to perform by hand without movement speed buffs. However, the characters that increase movement speed do not synergize well with Noelle in normal play. Performing dragonstrike on Noelle via N1 + plunge nets on average, about a 27% increase in DPS compared to N3D.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Breastplate" %}
Summon a shield that deals damage in a small radius around Noelle.

* Shield strength scales with Noelle’s current DEF.
* When hitting an enemy there is a chance to heal all characters in the party. 
* The amount healed scales with Noelle’s current DEF.
* The Shield possesses the following properties:
  * 150% DMG Absorption Efficiency against all damage.
  * Can trigger Crystallize when hitting a target with a element applied to them.

| Type | Talent 6% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Base DMG | 168% DEF |
| Healing | 29.79% DEF + 163 |
| Healing chance | 55% |
| Shield Scaling | 224% DEF + 1219 |
| Duration | 12 sec |
| Cooldown | 24 sec |
| GU | 2 |

* The shield damage from C4 is calculated using Noelle’s current attack at the moment the shield breaks.
* When the shield breaks it creates enough hitlag that you can perform a Plunge attack if you jump at the correct time, however unless you purposefully break the shield it can be hard to time correctly.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Sweeping Time" %}
Noelle infuses her sword with Geo energy greatly increasing the range of her normal attacks.

* Converts her Normal Attacks from Physical to Geo, this infusion cannot be overridden by other sources.
* Converts Noelle’s current total DEF into ATK at a rate decided by talent level.
* The skill and burst damage values apply to the first two hits in the animation when activating burst.

| Effect | Talent 6% / Data |
| :--- | :--- |
| Elemental burst DMG | 94.08% |
| Skill DMG | 129.92% |
| Def conversion | 56% DEF |
| Duration | 15s |
| Cooldown | 15s \(non-scaling\) |
| Energy Cost | 60 |
| Burst GU | 1 |
| Infused attack GU | 1 |
| Frames | 111 |

* The bonus DEF conversion from C6 is additive i.e. it takes the bonus from 56% to 106% at talent level 6.
* The DEF to ATK conversion is snapshotted when you activate burst so any changes to DEF after burst is used will not affect ATK.
* The two activation damage instances can proc the healing effect from **Breastplate**.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### **Maid’s Knighthood**

When a Perfect Cooking is achieved on a DEF-boosting dish, Noelle has a 12% chance to obtain double the product.

### **Devotion**

When Noelle is in the party but not on field, this ability triggers automatically when your active character’s HP falls below 30%.

* Creates a shield for your active character that lasts 20s and absorbs DMG equal to 400% of Noelle’s DEF.
* This shield has a 150% DMG absorption effectiveness against all damage.
* This effect can only occur once every 60s.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 4" %}
### **Nice and clean**

Every 4 Normal Attack or Charged Attack hits will decrease the CD of **Breastplate** by 1s.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C5" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C6" %}
