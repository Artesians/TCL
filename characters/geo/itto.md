When holding to perform a Charged Attack, Itto unleashes a series of Arataki Kesagiri slashes without consuming Stamina. Instead, each Arataki Kesagiri slash consumes 1 stack of Superlative Superstrength. When the final stack is consumed, Itto delivers a powerful final slash.
If no stacks of Superlative Superstrength are available, Itto will perform a single Saichimonji Slash.

Ushi will remain on the field and provide support in the following ways:
* Taunts surrounding opponents and draws their attacks.
* Inherits HP based on a percentage of Arataki Itto's Max HP.
* When Ushi takes DMG, Arataki Itto gains 1 stack of **Superlative Superstrength**. Only 1 stack can be gained in this way every 2s.
* Ushi will flee when its HP reaches 0 or its duration ends. It will grant Arataki Itto 1 stack of **Superlative Superstrength** when it leaves.

**Hold**
Adjust throwing angle.
Ushi is considered a Geo construct. Arataki Itto can only deploy 1 Ushi on the field at any one time.
