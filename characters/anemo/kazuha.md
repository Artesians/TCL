{% tab title="Chihayaburu" %}

Unleashes a secret technique as fierce as the rushing wind that pulls objects and opponents towards Kazuha's current position before launching opponents within the AoE, dealing Anemo DMG and lifting Kazuha into the air on a rushing gust of wind. Within 10s of remaining airborne after casting **Chihayaburu**, Kazuha can unleash a powerful Plunging Attack known as **Midare Ranzan**. 

* **Press:** Can be used in mid-air.

* **Hold:** Charges up before unleashing greater Anemo DMG over a larger AoE than Press Mode. 
  * Kazuha's Hold **Chihayaburu** can cause certain enemies to take Fall DMG.

**Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan**

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Kazuha Slash" %}
The signature technique of Kazuha's self-styled bladework â€” a single slash that strikes with the force of the first winds of autumn, dealing AoE Anemo DMG. The blade's passage will leave behind a field named "**Autumn Whirlwind**" that periodically deals AoE Anemo DMG to opponents within its range. 

**Elemental Absorption**  
If **Autumn Whirlwind** comes into contact with Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro, it will deal additional elemental DMG of that type. Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 1" %}
### **Soumon Swordsmanship**

If **Chihayaburu** comes into contact with Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro when cast, **Chihayaburu** will absorb that element and if **Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan** is used before the effect expires, it will deal an additional 200% ATK of the absorbed elemental type as DMG. This will be considered Plunging Attack DMG. Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use of Chihayaburu.

| Type | Soumon Swordsmanship |
| :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG | 200% |
| GU | 1A |
| Damage Element | Absorbed Element |

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 4" %}
### **Poetics of Fuubutsu**
