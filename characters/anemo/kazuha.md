| String | Talent 9% | Frames | MV/s | Poise Damage | Impulse Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Charged Attack DMG | 79% + 137.14% | 14 + 44 | - | 60 x2 | 2 + 6 |

| N1C w/Recovery | 79% + 137.14% | 78 | 229.82%/s | - | - |

**Plunge Attacks**  
Plunges from mid-air to strike the ground below, damaging opponents along the path and dealing AoE DMG upon impact. If this Plunging Attack is triggered by **Chihayaburu**, it will be converted to **Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan**. 

| String | Talent 9% | Poise Damage | Impulse Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Plunge DMG | 150.35% | 25 | 2 |
| Low Plunge DMG | 300.63% | 100 | 4 |
| High Plunge DMG | 375.50% | 150 | 7 |

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Chihayaburu" %}

Unleashes a secret technique as fierce as the rushing wind that pulls objects and opponents towards Kazuha's current position before launching opponents within the AoE, dealing Anemo DMG and lifting Kazuha into the air on a rushing gust of wind. Within 10s of remaining airborne after casting **Chihayaburu**, Kazuha can unleash a powerful Plunging Attack known as **Midare Ranzan**. 

**Press**  
Can be used in mid-air.

**Hold:**  
Charges up before unleashing greater Anemo DMG over a larger AoE than Press Mode. 

| Attribute | Tap | Hold |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG \(T9%\) | 326.4% | 443.36% |
| Particles | 3 | 4 |
| Frames | 36 | 69 |
| GU | 1U | 2U |
| ICD | None | None |
| Damage Element | Anemo | Anemo |
| Damage Type | Skill | Skill | 
| CD | 6s | 9s | 
| Poise Damage | 150 | 300 |
| Impulse Type | Air, 100, 800 | Air, 0, 800 |

**Notes**
* Kazuha's **Chihayaburu** (Hold) can cause certain enemies to take Fall DMG.
* By double tapping your glider as soon as you've tapped your skill on Kazuha, you can shorten the air time thereby landing on the ground a little bit faster if you don't intend to plunge (for example if you want to reapply VV shred to some frozen enemies but you don't want to shatter them).
* Some forms of interruption after casting **Chihayaburu** may cause the ability to cast **Midare Ranzan** to persist up to 10s without remaining airborne.
* Plunging immediately after a tap E guarantees a high plunge while waiting might give low plunge damage.

**Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan**  
When a Plunging Attack is performed using the effects of the Elemental Skill **Chihayaburu**, Plunging Attack DMG is converted to **Anemo** DMG. On landing, Kazuha creates a small wind tunnel via a secret blade technique that pulls in nearby objects and opponents.

| Attribute | Midare Ranzan |
| :--- | :--- |
| Plunge Collision DMG \(T9%\) | 150.35% |
| Low/High Plunge DMG \(T9%\) | 300.63% / 375.50% |
| Frames | 55 / 63 |
| GU | 1U |
| ICD | None |
| Damage Element | Anemo |
| Damage Type | Plunge |
| Plunge Poise Damage | 25 |
| Plunge Impulse Type | 1 |
| Low/High Plunge Poise Damage | 100 / 150 |
| Low/High Impulse Type | 7 |

* Absorption priority: Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo  
* Kazuha E will, under certain conditions, fail to absorb self auras
* **Midare Ranzan** does not have a minimum height limit, meaning Kazuha can start the Plunging Attack a lot lower than a regular Plunging Attack.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Kazuha Slash" %}
The signature technique of Kazuha's self-styled bladework â€” a single slash that strikes with the force of the first winds of autumn, dealing AoE Anemo DMG.  
The blade's passage will leave behind a field named "**Autumn Whirlwind**" that periodically deals AoE Anemo DMG to opponents within its range. 

**Elemental Absorption**  
If **Autumn Whirlwind** comes into contact with Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro, it will deal additional elemental DMG of that type. Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use.

| Effect | Slash | DoT | Elemental DMG |

## **Ascension Passives**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Passive" %}
### **Cloud Strider**

Decreases sprinting Stamina consumption for your own party members by 20%.
Not stackable with Passive Talents that provide the exact same effects.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 1" %}
### **Soumon Swordsmanship**

If **Chihayaburu** comes into contact with **Hydro**/**Pyro**/**Cryo**/**Electro** when cast, this **Chihayaburu** will absorb that element and if Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan is used before the effect expires, it will deal an additional 200% ATK of the absorbed elemental type as DMG. This will be considered Plunging Attack DMG.
Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use of **Chihayaburu**.

| Type | Soumon Swordsmanship |
| :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG | 200% |
| GU | 1A |
| Damage Element | Absorbed Element |
| Damage Type | Plunge |

**Notes**
* The elemental damage is applied before Midare Ranzan, allowing it to swirl without a pre-existing aura on enemies, additionally this also means that the applied aura can react with pre-existing aura, potentially resulting in no swirl. 
* Absorption priority: Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo   
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 4" %}
### **Poetics of Fuubutsu**

Upon triggering a Swirl reaction, Kaedehara Kazuha will grant all party members a 0.04% Elemental DMG Bonus to the element absorbed by Swirl for every point of Elemental Mastery he has for 8s. Bonuses for different elements obtained through this method can co-exist.

**Notes**
* Kazuha's 4th ascension passive works off-field and only gives bonus damage on swirled elements.
* Kazuha's 4th ascension passive will reflect his Elemental Mastery from the time of the Swirl, even if his Elemental Mastery later changes during its duration.
* Kazuha's 4th ascension passive overrides previous instances on every swirl of the same element, using his current Elemental Mastery.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## **Constellations**

{% tab title="C1" %}
### **Scarlet Hills**

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C5" %}
