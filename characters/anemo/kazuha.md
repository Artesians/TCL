* Kazuha cannot strike enemies that are lifted by Venti's Elemental Burst.

**Charged Attacks**

| String | Talent 9% | Frames | MV/s |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| N1C w/Recovery | 79% + 137.14% | 78 | 229.82%/s |

**Plunge Attacks**  
Plunges from mid-air to strike the ground below, damaging opponents along the path and dealing AoE DMG upon impact. If this Plunging Attack is triggered by **Chihayaburu**, it will be converted to **Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan**. 

| String | Talent 9% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Plunge DMG | 150.35% |
| Low/High Plunge DMG | 300.63% / 375.50% |

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Chihayaburu" %}

Unleashes a secret technique as fierce as the rushing wind that pulls objects and opponents towards Kazuha's current position before launching opponents within the AoE, dealing Anemo DMG and lifting Kazuha into the air on a rushing gust of wind. Within 10s of remaining airborne after casting **Chihayaburu**, Kazuha can unleash a powerful Plunging Attack known as **Midare Ranzan**. 

**Press**  
Can be used in mid-air.

**Hold:**  
Charges up before unleashing greater Anemo DMG over a larger AoE than Press Mode. 

| Attribute | Tap | Hold |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG \(T9%\) | 326.4% | 443.36% |
| Particles | 3 | 4 |
| Frames | 36 | 69 |
| GU | 1U | 2U |
| ICD | None | None |
| Damage Element | Anemo | Anemo |
| Damage Type | Skill | Skill | 
| CD | 6s | 9s | 

**Notes**
* Kazuha's **Chihayaburu** (Hold) can cause certain enemies to take Fall DMG.
* By double tapping your glider as soon as you've tapped your skill on Kazuha, you can shorten the air time thereby landing on the ground a little bit faster if you don't intend to plunge (for example if you want to reapply VV shred to some frozen enemies but you don't want to shatter them).

**Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan**  
When a Plunging Attack is performed using the effects of the Elemental Skill **Chihayaburu**, Plunging Attack DMG is converted to **Anemo** DMG. On landing, Kazuha creates a small wind tunnel via a secret blade technique that pulls in nearby objects and opponents.

| Attribute | Midare Ranzan |
| :--- | :--- |
| Plunge Collision DMG \(T9%\) | 150.35% |
| Low/High Plunge DMG \(T9%\) | 300.63% / 375.50% |
| Frames | 55 / 63 |
| GU | 1U |
| ICD | None |
| Damage Element | Anemo |
| Damage Type | Plunge |

* Absorption priority: Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo  

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Kazuha Slash" %}
The signature technique of Kazuha's self-styled bladework â€” a single slash that strikes with the force of the first winds of autumn, dealing AoE Anemo DMG.  
The blade's passage will leave behind a field named "**Autumn Whirlwind**" that periodically deals AoE Anemo DMG to opponents within its range. 

**Elemental Absorption**  
If **Autumn Whirlwind** comes into contact with Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro, it will deal additional elemental DMG of that type. Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use.

| Effect | Slash | DoT | Elemental DMG |
| :--- | :--- | ---- | :--- |
| Skill DMG \(T9%\) | 446.08% | 204% | 61.2% | 
| Frames | 93 | - | - |

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## **Ascension Passives**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Passive" %}
### **Cloud Strider**

Decreases sprinting Stamina consumption for your own party members by 20%. Not stackable with Passive Talents that provide the exact same effects.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 1" %}
### **Soumon Swordsmanship**

If **Chihayaburu** comes into contact with Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro when cast, **Chihayaburu** will absorb that element and if **Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan** is used before the effect expires, it will deal an additional 200% ATK of the absorbed elemental type as DMG. This will be considered Plunging Attack DMG. Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use of Chihayaburu.

| Type | Soumon Swordsmanship |
| :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG | 200% |
| GU | 1A |
| Damage Element | Absorbed Element |
| Damage Type | Plunge |

**Notes**
* The elemental damage is applied before Midare Ranzan, allowing it to swirl without a pre-existing aura on enemies, additionally this also means that the applied aura can react with pre-existing aura, potentially resulting in no swirl. 
* Absorption priority: Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo   
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 4" %}
### **Poetics of Fuubutsu**

Upon triggering a Swirl reaction, Kaedehara Kazuha will grant teammates a 0.04% Elemental DMG Bonus to their corresponding Element for every point of Elemental Mastery he has for 8s. Bonuses for different elements obtained through this method can co-exist.

**Notes**
* Kazuha's 4th ascension passive works off-field and only gives bonus damage on swirled elements.
* Kazuha's 4th ascension passive overrides previous instances on every swirl.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## **Constellations**

{% tabs %}

{% tab title="C1" %}
### **Scarlet Hills**

Decreases **Chihayaburu**'s CD by 10%. Using Kazuha Slash resets the CD of **Chihayaburu**.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C2" %}
### **Yamaarashi Tailwind**

The **Autumn Whirlwind** field created by **Kazuha Slash** has the following effects:  
* Increases Kaedehara Kazuha's own Elemental Mastery by 200.

{% endtab %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C5" %}
### **Wisdom of Bansei**

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C6" %}
