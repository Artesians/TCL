| String | Talent 9% | Frames | MV/s | Poise Damage | Impulse Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CA | 297.67% | 73 | 244.66%/s | 200 | Air, 0, 1050 |
* The Charged Attack visual and audio effect will appear on more than just enemies, as well as even appearing on enemies that don't get lifted at all.

**Plunge**

| Damage Type | Talent 9% | Poise Damage | Impulse Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Plunge DMG | 117.46% | 25 | 2 |
| Low Plunge DMG | 234.86% | 100 | 4 |
| High Plunge DMG | 293.36% | 150 | 7 |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Gale Blade" %}
**Press**  
Focusing the might of the formless wind around her blade, Jean releases a miniature storm, launching opponents in the direction she aims at, dealing massive Anemo DMG.

**Hold**  
At the cost of continued stamina consumption, Jean can command the whirlwind to pull surrounding opponents and objects towards her front.  
Direction can be adjusted.  
Character is immobile during skill duration. 

| Attribute | Skill |
| :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG \(T9%\) | 496.40% | 
| Particles | 2~3 \(1:2\) | 
| Frames | 46 |
| GU | 2U |
| ICD | None | 
| Snapshot | Dynamic | 
| Damage Element | Anemo | 
| Damage Type | Skill |
| Max Duration | 5s |
| CD | 6s | 
| Poise Damage | 250 |
| Impulse Type | 9 |

**Notes**
* Costs 20 stamina per second to hold.
* Enemies launched by **Gale Blade** can incur fall damage against the ground or walls.
  * Fall damage is based on a percentage of enemy health making it very useful against enemies with high health and low interruption resistance.
* While Jean cannot move you can move the camera to change where you are aiming with the blade.
* To be able to lift an enemy, Jean's level must be no more than 20 levels below the enemy's level.
* Fall damage for the hold variant can vary somewhat arbitrarily, as enemies held in **Gale Blade** will not be held completely still. 
* If **Gale Blade** \(E\) is held while looking down on falling enemies, they can take fall damage before being launched up again for a second instance of fall damage.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Dandelion Breeze" %}
Calling upon the wind's protection, Jean creates a swirling **Dandelion Field**, launching surrounding opponents and dealing Anemo DMG.  
At the same time, she instantly regenerates a large amount of HP for all party members. The amount of HP restored scales off Jean's ATK.

**Dandelion Field**
* Continuously regenerates HP of characters within the AoE and continuously imbues them with Anemo.
* Deals Anemo DMG to opponents entering or exiting the **Dandelion Field**.

| Attribute | Burst |
| :--- | :--- |
| Burst DMG \(T9%\) | 722.16% | 
| Field Enter/Exit DMG \(T9%\) | 133.28% | 
| Burst Healing \(T9%\) | 427.04% ATK + 3132 |
| Continuous Healing \(T9%\) | 42.7% ATK + 313 |
| Cast Frames | 88 |
| Energy Frame | 46 |
| CD Frame | 40 |
| GU | 2U |
| ICD | None | 
| Snapshot | Snapshots | 
| Damage Element | Anemo | 
| Damage Type | Burst |
| Energy Cost | 80 |
| Duration | 10s |
| CD | 20s | 
| Burst Poise Damage | 400 | 4 |
| Burst Impulse Type | 4 |
| Field Enter/Exit Poise Damage | 50 |
| Field Enter/Exit Impulse Type | 2 |

**Notes**
* Cast also knocks away light enemies.
* The **Dandelion Field** deals Anemo damage to enemies crossing the border of the field.
* **Dandelion Breeze** deals Field Enter/Exit DMG to enemies within its AOE on initial cast and when the duration of the **Dandelion Field** ends.
* Heals and applies Anemo continuously to the active character inside the field cleansing debuffs.
  * The continuous swirling of auras allows elements to spread to surrounding opponents when self-afflicted with an element.
  * With precise timing, Anemo can be the aura for self-swirls occasionally.  
  * This self-swirl interaction does not count as a reaction for Freedom\-Sworn Passive stacks and 4pc Instructor set effect.
  * In Sunfire \(when Jean's Burst and Bennett's Burst overlap\), if Jean triggers Overload the Freedom\-Sworn Passive will be activated.
