## **Attacks**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Favonius Bladework" %}
**Normal Attacks**  
Jean performs up to 5 consecutive attacks.

| String | Talent 6% | Frames | MV/s |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-Hit | 70.25% | 14 | 301%/s |
| 2-Hit | 66.25% | 37 | 221.35%/s |
| 3-Hit | 87.63% | 66 | 203.7%/s |

| 5-Hit | 115.13% | 159 | 164.1%/s |

**Charged Attack**  
Consumes 20 stamina to strike upwards and knocks up enemies that will then fall down slowly.

| String | Talent 6% | Frames | MV/s |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CA | 235.50% | 73 | 196.2%/s |
* The Charged Attack visual and audio effect will appear on more than just enemies, as well as even appearing on enemies that don't get lifted at all.

**Plunge**

| Damage Type | Talent 6% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Plunge Impact | 92.93% |
| Low Plunge DMG | 185.81% |
| High Plunge DMG | 232.09% |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Gale Blade" %}
**Press**  
Focusing the might of the formless wind around her blade, Jean releases a miniature storm, launching opponents in the direction she aims at, dealing massive Anemo DMG.

**Hold**  
At the cost of continued stamina consumption, Jean can command the whirlwind to pull surrounding opponents and objects towards her front.  
Direction can be adjusted.  
Character is immobile during skill duration. 

| Attribute | Skill |
| :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG \(T6%\) | 408.80% | 
| Particles | 2~3 \(1:2\) | 
| Frames | 46 |
| GU | 2U |
| ICD | None | 
| Snapshot | Dynamic | 
| Damage Element | Anemo | 
| Damage Type | Skill |
| Max Duration | 5s |
| CD | 6s | 

**Notes**
* Costs 20 stamina per second to hold.
* Enemies launched by **Gale Blade** can incur fall damage against the ground or walls.
  * Fall damage is based on a percentage of enemy health making it very useful against enemies with high health and low interruption resistance.
* While Jean cannot move you can move the camera to change where you are aiming with the blade.
* To be able to lift an enemy, Jean's level must be no more than 20 levels below the enemy's level.
* Fall damage for the hold variant can vary somewhat arbitrarily, as enemies held in **Gale Blade** will not be held completely still. 
* If **Gale Blade** \(E\) is held while looking down on falling enemies, they can take fall damage before being launched up again for a second instance of fall damage.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Dandelion Breeze" %}
Calling upon the wind's protection, Jean creates a swirling **Dandelion Field**, launching surrounding opponents and dealing Anemo DMG.  
At the same time, she instantly regenerates a large amount of HP for all party members. The amount of HP restored scales off Jean's ATK.

**Dandelion Field**
* Continuously regenerates HP of characters within the AoE and continuously imbues them with Anemo.
* Deals Anemo DMG to opponents entering or exiting the **Dandelion Field**.

| Attribute | Burst |
| :--- | :--- |
| Burst DMG \(T6%\) | 594.72% | 
| Field Enter/Exit DMG \(T6%\) | 109.76% | 
| Burst Healing \(T6%\) | 351.68% ATK + 2439 |
| Continuous Healing \(T6%\) | 35.17% ATK + 244 |
| Frames | 88 |
| GU | 2U |
| ICD | None | 
| Snapshot | Snapshots | 
| Damage Element | Anemo | 
| Damage Type | Burst |
| Energy Cost | 80 |
| Duration | 10s |
| CD | 20s | 

**Notes**
* Cast also knocks away light enemies.
* The **Dandelion Field** deals Anemo damage to enemies crossing the border of the field.
* **Dandelion Breeze** deals Field Enter/Exit DMG to enemies within its AOE on initial cast and when the duration of the **Dandelion Field** ends.
* Heals and applies Anemo continuously to the active character inside the field cleansing debuffs.
  * The continuous swirling of auras allows elements to spread to surrounding opponents when self-afflicted with an element.
 * With precise timing, Anemo can be the aura for self-swirls occasionally.
