{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Yoohoo Art: Fuuin Dash" %}
The special technique of the Yoohoo Ninja Arts!  
Sayu curls up into a rolling **Fuufuu Windwheel** and smashes into opponents at high speed, dealing Anemo DMG. When the duration ends, she unleashes a **Fuufuu Whirlwind Kick**, dealing AoE Anemo DMG. 

**Press**  
Enters the **Fuufuu Windwheel** state, rolling forward a short distance before using the **Fuufuu Whirlwind Kick**. 

**Hold**  
Rolls about continuously in the **Fuufuu Windwheel** state, increasing Sayu's resistance to interruption while within that state.  
During this time, Sayu can control the direction of her roll, and can use the skill again to end her **Windwheel** state early and unleash a stronger version of the **Fuufuu Whirlwind** Kick.  
The Hold version of this skill can trigger Elemental Absorption.  
This skill has a maximum duration of 10s and enters CD once its effects end. The longer Sayu remains in her **Windwheel** state, the longer the CD. 


**Elemental Absorption**  
If Sayu comes into contact with Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro while in her **Windwheel** state, she will deal additional elemental DMG of that type.  
Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use of this skill.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Yoohoo Art: Mujina Flurry" %}
The other super special technique of the Yoohoo Ninja Arts! It summons a pair of helping hands for Sayu. Deals Anemo DMG to nearby opponents and heals all nearby party members. The amount of HP restored is based on Sayu's ATK. This skill then summons a **Muji-Muji Daruma**.

**Muji-Muji Daruma**  
At specific intervals, the **Daruma** will take one of several actions based on the situation around it: 
* If the HP of nearby characters is above 70%, it will attack a nearby opponent, dealing Anemo DMG. 
* If there are active characters with 70% or less HP nearby, it will heal the active character with the lowest percentage HP left. If there are no opponents nearby, it will heal active characters nearby even if they have 70% HP or more.

## **Ascension Passives**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Passive" %}
### **Yoohoo Art: Silencer's Secret**

When Sayu is in the party, your characters will not startle Crystalflies and certain other animals when getting near them.
Check the "Other" sub-category of the "Living Beings / Wildlife" section in the Archive for creatures this skill works on.

**Notes**
* Passive works even if Sayu is off-field.
* If entities are connected (like crystalflies), then picking them up will always scare the others.
* If entities do not care about the state of other beings, then picking it up next to another one won't startle them.
* Sayu's passive does not affect coop members - works only for your own party.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 1" %}
### **Someone More Capable**

When Sayu triggers a Swirl reaction while active, she heals all your characters and nearby allies for 300 HP. She will also heal an additional 1.2 HP for every point of Elemental Mastery she has.
