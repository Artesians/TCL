| :--- | :--- |

| High Plunge DMG | 206.30% |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Skyward Sonnet" %}
**Press**

Summons an **Wind Domain** at the opponent's location, dealing AoE Anemo DMG and launching opponents into the air.

**Hold**

Summons a larger **Wind Domain** at Venti's location, dealing AoE Anemo DMG and launching opponents into the air. Venti then rides the winds into the air.

* Opponents launched by **Skyward Sonnet** will fall to the ground slowly.

| Attribute | Tap | Hold |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG (T6%) | 386.40% | 532% |
| Particles | 3 \(-\) | 4 \(-\) |
| Frames | 20 | 70 |
| GU | 2U | 2U | 
| ICD | 3 hit / 2.5s | 3 hit / 2.5s |
| Snapshot | - | - |
| Damage Element | Anemo | Anemo | 
| Damage Type | Skill | Skill |
| Cooldown | 6s | 15s |

* Doing an auto attack as soon as possible after using the press version of **Skyward Sonnet** allows the user to swap to a different character faster.
* Venti can shorten the starting animation of the press version of **Skyward Sonnet** by holding Elemental Skill for 9 frames, which starts the animation for the hold version of **Skyward Sonnet**, and then releasing, which cancels the hold version into a press version of **Skyward Sonnett**. This allows Venti to perform an action immediately after. In total, the **Skyward Sonnet** cast can be cancelled to be only 10 frames.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Wind\'s Grand Ode" %}
Venti fires off an arrow made of countless coalesced winds, creating a huge **Stormeye** that sucks in opponents and deals continuous Anemo DMG.

**Elemental Absorption**

* If the **Stormeye** comes into contact with **Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro,** it will deal additional elemental DMG of that type.
* This can only occur once per use.

| Attribute | Burst DoT | Burst Additional Elemental DMG |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG (T6%) | 52.64% | 26.32% |
| Frames | 94 | - |
| GU | 1U | 1A |
| ICD | 3 hits / 2.5s | 3 hits / 2.5s |
| Duration | 8s | 6.4s |
| Total Ticks | 20 | 16 |
| Snapshot | Snapshot | Snapshot |
| Damage Element | Anemo | Absorbed Element | 
| Damage Type | Burst | Burst |
| CD | 15s | - |
| Energy Cost | 60 | - |

* The **Stormeye** is elevated above the ground. Some attacks are unable to hit enemies that are lifted.
* Venti cannot lift enemies that are more than 20 levels above his level.
* Elemental absorption can occur at soonest, **after the 4th Anemo tick**
    * The additional elemental DMG will always deal 16 ticks of damage in the original burst area, no matter the time of absorption.
    * The absorption DMG does not share ICD with the DoT DMG
* Venti's vortex can be fired on top of Zhongli's pillar, allowing Venti to pull in targets whilst keeping them just low enough for melee units to hit.  
* Absorption priority: Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo  

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C6" %}
### Storm of Defiance

Targets who take DMG from **Wind's Grand Ode** have their Anemo RES decreased by 20%.

If an **Elemental Absorption** occurred, then their RES towards the corresponding Element is also decreased by 20%.

* The resistance reduction from Venti C6 lasts 10 seconds from the last tick of damage taken. Anemo res reduction duration can only be refreshed by anemo dmg ticks, while the infused element's res reduction duration is refreshed by that element's DOT ticks.
