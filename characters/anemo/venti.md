**Plunge Attack**  
Fire a shower of arrows from mid-air before falling striking the ground, dealing AoE DMG.

| Type | Talent 9% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Plunge DMG | 104.41% |
| Low Plunge DMG | 208.77% |
| High Plunge DMG | 260.76% |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Skyward Sonnet" %}
O wind upon which all hymns and songs fly, bear these earth-walkers up into the sky!

**Press**  
Summons an **Wind Domain** at the opponent's location, dealing AoE Anemo DMG and launching opponents into the air.

**Hold**  
Summons a larger **Wind Domain** at Venti's location, dealing AoE Anemo DMG and launching opponents into the air. Venti then rides the winds into the air.  
Opponents launched by **Skyward Sonnet** will fall to the ground slowly.

| Attribute | Tap | Hold |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG (T9%) | 469.20% | 646% |
| Particles | 3 \(-\) | 4 \(-\) |
| Frames | 20 | 70 |
| GU | 2U | 2U | 
| ICD | 3 hit / 2.5s | 3 hit / 2.5s |
| Snapshot | - | - |
| Damage Element | Anemo | Anemo | 
| Damage Type | Skill | Skill |
| Cooldown | 6s | 15s |

**Notes**
* Doing an auto attack as soon as possible after using the press version of **Skyward Sonnet** allows the user to swap to a different character faster.
* Venti can shorten the starting animation of the press version of **Skyward Sonnet** by holding Elemental Skill for 9 frames, which starts the animation for the hold version of **Skyward Sonnet**, and then releasing, which cancels the hold version into a press version of **Skyward Sonnett**. This allows Venti to perform an action immediately after. In total, the **Skyward Sonnet** cast can be cancelled to be only 10 frames.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Wind&apos;s Grand Ode" %}
Fires off an arrow made of countless coalesced winds, creating a huge **Stormeye** that sucks in opponents and deals continuous Anemo DMG.

**Elemental Absorption**  
If the **Stormeye** comes into contact with **Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro,** it will deal additional elemental DMG of that type.  
This can only occur once per use.

| Attribute | Burst DoT | Burst Additional Elemental DMG |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG (T9%) | 63.92% * 20| 31.96% * 15\*|
| Cast Frames | 94 | - |
| Energy Frame | 90 | - |
| CD Frame | 83 | - |
| GU | 1U | 1A |
| ICD | 3 hits | 3 hits |
| Duration | 8s | 6.0s |
| Total Ticks | 20 | 15\* (FPS Dependent) |
| Snapshot | Snapshot | Snapshot |
| Damage Element | Anemo | Absorbed Element | 
| Damage Type | Burst | Burst |
| CD | 15s | - |
| Energy Cost | 60 | - |

**Notes**
* Absorption priority: Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo  
* The **Stormeye** is elevated above the ground. Some attacks are unable to hit enemies that are lifted.
* Venti cannot lift enemies that are more than 20 levels above his level.
* Elemental absorption can occur at soonest, **after the 4th Anemo tick**
    * The additional elemental DMG will deal 13-15 ticks of damage in the original burst area, no matter the time of absorption.
    * The absorption DMG does not share ICD with the DoT DMG
* Venti's vortex can be fired on top of Zhongli's pillar, allowing Venti to pull in targets whilst keeping them just low enough for melee units to hit.  

\* Number of ticks is FPS-dependent and inconsistent. 13 or 14 ticks at 30 FPS. 14 or 15 ticks at 60 FPS.
