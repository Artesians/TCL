{% tab title="Transcendence: Baleful Omen" %}
The Raiden Shogun unveils a shard of her Euthymia, dealing Electro DMG to nearby opponents, and granting nearby party members the **Eye of Stormy Judgment**. 

**Eye of Stormy Judgment**  
* When characters with this buff attacks and deal DMG to opponents, the **Eye** will unleash a coordinated attack, dealing AoE Electro DMG at the opponent's position. 
* Characters who gain the **Eye of Stormy Judgment** will have their Elemental Burst DMG increased based on the Energy Cost of the Elemental Burst during the Eye's duration.  

The Eye can initiate one coordinated attack every 0.9s per party. Coordinated attacks generated by characters not controlled by you deal 20% of the normal DMG.

| Type | Skill | Coordinated Attack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| Skill DMG \(T6%\) | 164.08% | 58.8% |
| Elemental Burst DMG Bonus \(T6%\) | 0.27% Per Energy | - |

* Raiden's E coordinated attack CD starts with the triggering move's damage, not with the coordinated attack's.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Secret Art: Musou Shinsetsu" %} 
Gathering truths unnumbered and wishes uncounted, the Raiden Shogun unleashes the **Musou no Hitotachi** and deals AoE Electro DMG, using **Musou Isshin** in combat for a certain duration afterward. The DMG dealt by **Musou no Hitotachi** and **Musou Isshin's** attacks will be increased based on the number of **Chakra Desiderata's Resolve Stacks** consumed when this skill is used. 

**Musou Isshin**  
While in this state, the Raiden Shogun will wield her tachi in battle, while her Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks will be converted to Electro DMG and considered Elemental Burst damage. When such attacks hit opponents, she will regenerate Energy for all nearby party members. Energy can be restored this way once every 1s, and this effect can be triggered 5 times throughout this skill's duration. While in this state, the Raiden Shogun's resistance to interruption is increased, and she is immune to Electro-Charged reaction DMG. The effects of **Musou Isshin** will be cleared when the Raiden Shogun leaves the field.

**Chakra Desiderata**  
When nearby party members (excluding the Raiden Shogun herself) use their Elemental Bursts, the Raiden Shogun will build up **Resolve Stacks** based on the Energy Cost of these Elemental Bursts. The maximum number of **Resolve Stacks** is 60. The Resolve gained by **Chakra Desiderata** will be cleared ~300s after the Raiden Shogun leaves the field.
