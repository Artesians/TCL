| String | Talent 6% | GU | Frames | Motion Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| :--- | :--- |
| Plunge Impact | 82.60% |
| Low Plunge DMG | 165.16% |
| High Plunge DMG | 206.3% |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Nightrider" %}
**Press**  
Fischl summons **Oz** a short distance in front of herself and deals Electro DMG in a small AoE at the summon location.

* When **Oz** is already on the field, this ability repositions him next to Fischl instead, without modifying his remaining duration.

| Effect | Talent% / Data |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cast DMG | 161.62% |
| Summon Cooldown | 25s |
| Reposition Cooldown | 1s |

| Normal Attack | 124.32% |

| Damage Type | Elemental Skill |

* **Oz** has a duration of 10s.

* **Oz** has an elemental application ICD of 3-4s, so every 4th hit will apply Electro. Additionally hits 1-6 are considered a separate elemental source from hits 7-10. Thus, against a single target, hits 1, 5, 7 apply electro to the target.
* Additionally, when **Oz’s** normal attack triggers an Overload or Superconduct reaction, it generates 1 particle per enemy hit by the reaction.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Midnight Phantasmagoria" %}
Fischl transforms into **Oz** and gains movement speed. Deals Electro damage to enemies Fischl comes into contact with, once per enemy.

* Fischl may not attack, cast, or dash during the duration of this ability. 
* Summons **Oz** when the effect ends. 
* If **Oz** is already on the field, this will reset his duration instead.

| Effect | Talent 6% / Data |

## Turbo

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Overview" %}
When Oz triggers Overload or Superconduct with his **Normal Attack**, he generates a particle for each enemy hit by the reaction. This is called "**turbo**" energy generation. By this using this mechanic in clumps of enemies, you can gain far more particles per Oz summon than you would normally be able to. Turbo team compositions are built to force this interaction often to fuel expensive elemental bursts. This in turn reduces the energy recharge investment for units, which allows for more investment into damage.

| Number of Enemies | C0-C5 Particles | C6 Particles |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 40.8 | 50 |
| 2 | 52.8 | 65 |
| 3 | 64.8 | 80 |
| 4 | 76.8 | 95 |
| 5 | 88.8 | 110 |
| 6 | 100.8 | 125 |
| 7 | 112.8 | 140 |

_Assumptions: maximum uptime utilizing burst, Oz is the trigger for all 10/12 attacks, and the reactions that occur hit all enemies for 12/15 reactions per minute._

{% tab title="Team Comps" %}
**Units in a Turbo Team**

* Fischl
* Aura Setter
  * Cryo Unit for Superconduct Turbo
  * Pyro Unit for Overload Turbo
* Last two slots are flexible
  * Although for Superconduct Turbo, a secondary cryo unit may be required to maintain cryo aura

**Pyro Aura**

* Xiangling
* Klee

**Cryo Aura**

* Kaeya + Chongyun
* Kaeya + Diona

**Flex Slot**

Any unit fits here, but the units that benefit most from Turbo are energy hungry units. Since turbo allows team compositions to capitalize on turbo's obscene energy generation by running **Beidou**, **Xiangling**, and/or **Xingqiu** on more offense oriented stats over energy recharge.

**Important:** Always use the Aura Setter's burst before deploying Oz in your rotations, the opposite may yield electro aura and not generate energy.

Note: When using a character with the same element as the current aura you will not be able to utilize fischls A4 as the current active character will not be a trigger.
