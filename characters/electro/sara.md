* **Tengu Juurai: Ambush** DMG is snapshot upon **Tengu Stormcall** cast.
* Sara does not lose the effects of **Crowfeather Cover** if swapped off.
* **Crowfeather** does not stick to walls; it sticks to the closest walkable surface from the point of collision.
* A fully-charged aimed shot fired with **Crowfeather Cover** will disappear after 2 seconds in flight.
* **Crowfeather** triggers **Tengu Juurai: Ambush** 1.5s after landing.
