**Crowfeathers** will trigger **Tengu Juurai: Ambush** after a short time, dealing Electro DMG and granting the active character within its AoE an ATK Bonus based on Kujou Sara's Base ATK.  
The ATK Bonuses from different **Tengu Juurai** will not stack, and their effects and duration will be determined by the last **Tengu Juurai** to take effect.

**Notes**
* **Tengu Stormcall** only buffs the on-field characters the frame before the Crowfeather Explosion, this also applies to coop members.
* Triggering **Tengu Juurai: Ambush** doesn't require hitting an enemy, just a fully-charged aimed shot.
* **Tengu Juurai: Ambush** DMG is snapshot upon **Tengu Stormcall** cast.
* Sara does not lose the effects of **Crowfeather Cover** if swapped off.
* **Crowfeather** does not stick to walls; it sticks to the closest walkable surface from the point of collision.
* A fully-charged aimed shot fired with **Crowfeather Cover** will disappear after 2 seconds in flight.
* **Crowfeather** triggers **Tengu Juurai: Ambush** 1.5s after landing.
* **Crowfeather** has a "semi-taunt" mechanic, where it can draw enemy attention even while not in combat mode.
* The hitbox to gain an ATK buff from **Tengu Juurai: Ambush** is massive vertically.
* The damage hitbox of **Tengu Juurai: Ambush** is different from the hitbox to gain an ATK Buff.
* **Tengu Juurai: Ambush** is a unique "friendly fire" attack and can trigger several other characters's perks that require getting hit.
* When Sara is near an enemy, **Tengu Stormcall** will teleport her away from them. 
* When Sara is not near any enemies, **Tengu Stormcall** will teleport her backwards. The player can also choose to control the teleport by inputting a direction before the teleport occurs.

**Tengu Juurai: Titanbreaker** and **Tengu Juurai: Stormcluster** can provide the active character within their AoE with the same ATK Bonus as given by the Elemental Skill, **Tengu Stormcall**.  
The ATK Bonus provided by various kinds of **Tengu Juurai** will not stack, and their effects and duration will be determined by the last **Tengu Juurai** to take effect.

* Both **Titanbreaker** and **Stormcluster** damage is snapshot on **Subjugation: Koukou Sendou** cast.
* For Sara's ATK bonus to apply, a character needs to be hit by **Titanbreaker** or **Stormclusters**.
    * Multiple characters can be buffed this way. 
* **Titanbreaker** targets closest enemy, then **Stormcluster** moves outward in a plus-shape with one branch directed at Saraâ€™s location at time of cast, dealing 5 hits each.
