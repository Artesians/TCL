description: The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Keqing has much to say about Rex Lapis' unilateral approach to policymaking in Liyue — but in truth, gods admire skeptics such as her quite a lot.

| String | Talent 9% | Frames | MV/s | Poise Damage | Impulse Type |

| 5-Hit | 123.08% | 133 | 223.25%/s | 64.8 | 7 |

**Charged Attack**  
Keqing consumes 25 stamina to unleash 2 rapid strikes.

| String | Talent 9% | Poise Damage | Impulse Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Charged Attack | 141.09% + 158% | 47.3 x2 | 2 + 6 |

| String | Frames | MV/s (Talent 9%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| N1C | 63 | 356.63%/s |
| N4C | 150 | 268.35%/s |

* Keqing's N1C is her highest damage combo but is stamina hungry.
  * N4C is a comparable damage combo that is less stamina intensive.

**Plunge**  
Plunges from mid-air to strike the ground below, damaging opponents along the path and dealing AoE DMG upon impact.

| Type | Talent 9% | Poise Damage | Impulse Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Plunge DMG | 117.46% | 25 | 2 |
| Low Plunge DMG | 234.86% | 100 | 4 |
| High Plunge DMG | 293.36% | 150 | 7 |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Stellar Restoration" %}
**Press**  
Hurls a **Lightning Stiletto** that annihilates her opponents like the swift thunder.  
When the **Stiletto** hits its target, it deals Electro DMG to opponents in a small AoE, and places a **Stiletto Mark** on the spot hit.

**Hold**  
Hold to adjust the direction in which the **Stiletto** shall be thrown.  
**Stilettos** thrown by the Hold attack mode can be suspended in mid-air, allowing Keqing to jump to them when using Stellar Restoration a second time.

**Lightning Stiletto \(recast\)**  
If Keqing uses **Stellar Restoration** again or uses a **Charged Attack** while its duration lasts, it will clear the **Stiletto Mark** and produce different effects:  
• If she uses **Stellar Restoration** again, she will blink to the location of the Mark and unleash one slashing attack that deals AoE Electro DMG. When blinking to a Stiletto that was thrown from a Holding attack, Keqing can leap across obstructing terrain.  
• If Keqing uses a **Charged Attack**, she will ignite a series of thundering cuts at the Mark's location, dealing AoE Electro DMG.  

| Attribute | Lightning Stiletto | Thunderclap Slash |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Lightning Stiletto \(T9%\) | 85.68% | - |
| Stiletto Mark Secondary \(T9%\) | 285.6% | 142.8% x 2 |

| Poise Damage | Lightning Stiletto: 50 <br> Slashing: 100 | 50 x2 |
| Impulse Type | Lightning Stiletto: 3 <br> Slashing: Air, 0, 600 | 2 x2 |

**Notes**
* When blinking to a **Stiletto Mark** that was thrown from a Holding cast, Keqing can move across obstructions and glide or initiate a plunge attack.
* Keqing's second **Stellar Restoration** cast is buffered during her dash.
* Keqing can gain 2 stacks of 4pc Pale Flame in one cast of **Stellar Restoration** by dropping a **Stilleto Mark** on a enemy and performing a charge attack.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Starward Sword" %}
Keqing unleashes the power of lightning, dealing Electro DMG in an AOE.  
She then blends into the shadow of her blade, striking a series of thunderclap-blows to nearby opponents simultaneously that deal multiple instances of Electro DMG. The final attack deals massive AoE Electro DMG.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Passive" %}
### **Land's Overseer**

When dispatched on an expedition in Liyue, time consumed is reduced by 25%.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 1" %}
### **Thundering Penance**

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## **Constellations**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="C1" %}
### **Thundering Might**

Recasting **Stellar Restoration** while a **Lightning Stiletto** is present causes Keqing to deal 50% of her ATK as **AoE Electro DMG** at the start point and terminus of her Blink.

* An enemy can be hit twice by the **Thundering Might** AoE if **Stellar Restoration** is recast at point blank range. However, it can be inconsistent on smaller enemies since the AoE is small.
* C1 damage instance has no ability type scaling tags.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C2" %}
### **Keen Extraction**

When Keqing's Normal and Charged Attacks hit opponents affected by **Electro**, they have a 50% chance of producing an Elemental Particle.  
This effect can only occur once every 5s.

| Poise Damage | Impulse Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| 50 | 1 |

* The proc rate of **Keen Extraction** is inconsistent, and does not work as stated.  
  * For more details, see the [full entry](../../evidence/characters/electro/keqing.md#keqing-c2-procs-inconsistently) in Keqing's Evidence Vault.
