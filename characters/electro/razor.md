{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Steel Fang" %}
**Normal Attacks**  
Razor performs 4 consecutive strikes.

| 4-Hit | 228.81% | 192 | 219.64%/s |

* 3-hit cancel is the best DPS outside of Lighting Fang.
* 4-hit cancel has the best DPS under the effect of Lightning Fang, but the fourth hit has significant knockback so 3-hit may be optimal in certain situations.

**Charged Attack**  
Drains Stamina over time to perform continuous spinning attacks against all nearby opponents.  
At the end of the sequence, perform a more powerful slash. 

| String | Talent 9% | Frames | MV/s |

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Claw and Thunder" %}
Hunts his prey using the techniques taught to him by his master and his lupical.

**Press**  
Swings the Thunder Wolf Claw, dealing Electro DMG to opponents in front of Razor.  
Upon striking an opponent, Razor will gain an Electro Sigil, which increases his Energy Recharge rate.  
Razor can have up to 3 Electro Sigils simultaneously, and gaining a new Electro Sigil refreshes their duration.

**Hold**

Gathers Electro energy to unleash a lightning storm over a small AoE, causing massive Electro DMG, and clears all of Razor's Electro Sigils.  
Each Electro Sigil cleared in this manner will be converted into Energy for Razor.



| Attribute | Skill (Tap) | Skill (Hold) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG \(T9%\) | 338.64% | 501.84% |
| Particles | 3 \(-\) | 4 \(-\) | 
| Frames | 74 | 92 | 
| GU | 2B | 2B |
| ICD | 3 hits/2.5s | 3 hits/2.5s |
| Snapshot | Dynamic | Dynamic |
| Damage Element | Electro | Electro | 
| Damage Type | Skill | Skill | 
| CD | 6s | 10s | 

**Notes**
* When hitting an enemy generates one **Electro Sigil**, you can have three **Sigils** at once and each **Sigil** increases Razor's ER by 20%.
* The duration of the sigils is 18s and is refreshed every time you press **Claw and Thunder**.
* **Claw and Thunder**'s animation is different and slightly slower during **Lightning Fang**.
* During **Claw and Thunder** (Hold), any active **Sigils** will be absorbed by Razor granting him 5 energy for each sigil.
  * This energy is not affected by ER.
* **Claw and Thunder** (Hold) causes a small self-knockback when used.
* The **Electro Sigils** are not immediately consumed when dashing after Hold E.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Lightning Fang" %}
Summons **the Wolf Within**, which deals Electro DMG to all nearby opponents. This clears all of Razor's Electro Sigils, which will be converted into Elemental Energy for him.  
**The Wolf Within** will fight alongside Razor for the skill's duration.

**The Wolf Within**  
• Strikes alongside Razor's normal attacks, dealing Electro DMG.  
• Raises Razor's ATK SPD and Electro RES.  
• Causes Razor to be immune to DMG inflicted by the Electro-Charged status.  
• Disables Razor's Charged Attacks.  
• Increases Razor's resistance to interruption.  
These effects end when Razor leaves the battlefield.

When Razor leaves the field, a maximum of 10 Energy will be returned to him based off the duration remaining on this skill.

**Notes**
* Any active **Sigils** will be absorbed by Razor granting him 5 energy for each **Sigil**.
* Razor’s hold E does not cause a minor self-knockback unlike outside of **Lightning Fang**.  
* While the effects of **Elemental Burst: Lightning Fang** are active, the energy particle generation of **Elemental Skill: Claw and Thunder** is disabled.
* The duration of **Lightning Fang** can be extended by hitlag
* Superconduct triggered by enemy Cryo attacks while Razor's **Lightning Fang** is active will affect nearby enemies as well as Razor.
* Bennett’s **Fantastic Voyage** self pyro application can react with Razor’s self electro application to proc overload on yourself. 
  * This effect does not harm you, but it deals two ticks of damage and knocks small mobs back.
