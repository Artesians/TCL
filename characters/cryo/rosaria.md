## **Ascension Passives**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Passive" %}
### **Night Walk**

At night \(18:00-6:00\), increases the Movement Speed of your own party members by 10%. Does not take effect in Domains, Trounce Domains, or Spiral Abyss.  
Not stackable with Passive Talents that provide the exact same effect.  
* The passive also doesn't work in the Serenitea Pot.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 1" %}
### **Regina Probationum**

When Rosaria strikes an opponent from behind using **Ravaging Confession**, Rosaria's CRIT RATE increases by 12% for 5s.

**Notes**
* Either damage instance of **Ravaging Confession** can trigger this passive.
* This CRIT RATE increase shows up in her stat screen, meaning it can be snapshotted by her A4, **Shadow Samaritan**, and included in the CRIT RATE sharing.
* Rosaria doesn't gain the CRIT RATE bonus unless the use of **Ravaging Confession** lands her behind the enemy.
  * If Rosaria starts her skill behind an enemy, but that enemy turns around to face her before the two hits, she won't get the CRIT RATE bonus.  
  * For enemies who don’t have visual distinction between front and behind, Rosaria can still activate her A1 by hitting them from certain angles.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 4" %}
### **Shadow Samaritan**

Casting **Rites of Termination** increases CRIT RATE of all nearby party members, excluding Rosaria herself, by 15% of Rosaria's CRIT RATE for 10s. CRIT RATE bonus gained this way cannot exceed 15%.

* The CRIT RATE shared by **Shadow Samaritan** can be stacked with external CRIT buffs that show up in a character's stat sheet
  * For example, the CRIT RATE shared by **Shadow Samaritan** stacks with both Hu Tao's A1 talent and Geo MC C1.
