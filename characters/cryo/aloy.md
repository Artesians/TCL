{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Frozen Wilds" %}
Aloy throws a **Freeze Bomb** in the targeted direction that explodes on impact, dealing Cryo DMG. After it explodes, the **Freeze Bomb** will split up into many **Chillwater Bomblets** that explode on contact with opponents or after a short delay, dealing Cryo DMG.  
When a **Freeze Bomb** or **Chillwater Bomblet** hits an opponent, the opponent's ATK is decreased and Aloy receives 1 **Coil stack**.  
Aloy can gain up to 1 **Coil stack** every 0.1s. 

**Coil**  
• Each stack increases Aloy's Normal Attack DMG.  
• When Aloy has 4 **Coil stacks**, all stacks of **Coil** are cleared. She then enters the **Rushing Ice** state, which further increases the DMG dealt by her Normal Attacks and converts her Normal Attack DMG to Cryo DMG. 

While in the **Rushing Ice** state, Aloy cannot obtain new **Coil** stacks.  
**Coil** effects will be cleared 30s after Aloy leaves the field.
