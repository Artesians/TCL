{% tab title="Celestial Shower" %}
Coalesces atmospheric frost and snow to summon a **Sacred Cryo Pearl** that exorcises evil.
During its ability duration, the **Sacred Cryo Pearl** will continuously rain down shards of ice, striking opponents within an AoE and dealing **Cryo** DMG.

**Notes**
* Celestial Shower drops **Ice Shards** every 0.3 seconds.
* The **Sacred Cryo Pearl** will drop a shard **on a random enemy within the field that has not been targeted by a shard in the last 4** **Ice Shards**.
* If there are no enemies that have not been targeted by the last 4 shards, they will randomly drop within the field where the shard AoE can still strike a target.
* Ganyu's icicles follow standard ICD (3-hit/2.5s).
* Ganyu's icicles are more likely to hit targets that are larger in size.
* If **Celestial Shower** is cast before the previous one ends through the use of cooldown reduction, the existing field will end prematurely.
