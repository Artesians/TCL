| Type | Talent 9% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Spinning DMG | 126.4% |
| Final DMG | 228.55% |
| Stamina Cost | 40/s |

**Plunge Attack**

| Type | Talent 9% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Plunge DMG | 137.03% |
| Low Plunge DMG | 274.01% |
| High Plunge DMG | 342.25% |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Icetide Vortex" %}  
Sharp frost, swift blade.

**Press**  
Slashes swiftly, dealing **Cryo** DMG.  
When it hits an opponent, Eula gains a stack of **Grimheart** that stacks up to 2 times. These stacks can only be gained once every 0.3 seconds.

**Grimheart**  
Increases Eula's resistance to interruption and DEF.

**Hold**  
Wielding her sword, Eula consumes all the stacks of **Grimheart** and lashes forward, dealing AoE Cryo DMG to opponents in front of her.  
If **Grimheart** stacks are consumed, surrounding opponents will have their Physical RES and Cryo RES decreased.  
Each consumed stack of **Grimheart** will be converted into an **Icewhirl Brand** that deals Cryo DMG to nearby opponents.

| Attribute | Press | Hold | Icewhirl Brand | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG \(T9%\) | 248.88% | 417.52% | 163.2% | 
| Particles | 1~2 \(1:1\) | 2~3 \(1:1\) | - |
| Frames | 65 | 89 | - |
| GU | 1A | 1A | 1A | 
| ICD | None | None | 3 hits / 2.5s |
| Snapshot | - | - | - | 
| Damage Element | Cryo | Cryo | Cryo | 
| Damage Type | Skill | Skill | Skill | 
| CD | 4s | 10s | - |

* Both variants of E are considered blunt attacks, but **Icewhirl Brands** are not.

**Grimheart**  
Increases Eula's resistance to interruption and her DEF.

| Attribute | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| DEF Bonus | 30% per stack |
| Phys RES Decrease \(T9%\) | 24% |
| Cryo Res Decrease \(T9%\) | 24% | 
| RES Decrease Duration | 7s per stack |
| Grimheart Duration | 18s |

* **Grimheart** stacks persist on switch.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Glacial Illumination" %}  
Brandishes her greatsword, dealing Cryo DMG to nearby opponents and creating a **Lightfall Sword** that follows her around for a duration of up to 7s.  
While present, the **Lightfall Sword** increases Eula's resistance to interruption. When Eula's own Normal Attack, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst deal DMG to opponents, they will charge the **Lightfall Sword**, which can gain an energy stack once every 0.1s.  
Once its duration ends, the **Lightfall Sword** will descend and explode violently, dealing Physical DMG to nearby opponents.  
This DMG scales on the number of energy stacks the **Lightfall Sword** has accumulated.  
If Eula leaves the field, the **Lightfall Sword** will explode immediately.

| Attribute | Skill | Lightfall Sword |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| Skill DMG \(T9%\) | 417.52% | - |
| Lightfall Sword Base DMG \(T9%\) | - | 674.34% |
| DMG Per Stack \(T9%\) | - | 137.78% |
| Frames | 125 | - |
| GU | 2B | None |

| Damage Element | Cryo | Physical | 
| Damage Type | Burst | Burst |
| Energy Cost | 80 | - | 
| Duration | - | 7s | 
| CD | 20s | - | 

**Notes**
* **Glacial Illumination** does not snapshot.
  * **Lightfall Sword** is still updating live stats when it lights up and is about to explode.
  * Lightfall stacks cannot be gained once **Lightfall Sword** lights up right before exploding.
  * **Lightfall Sword** does not snapshot even after Eula is swapped off-field, allowing for a 23 frame window to apply team buffs and increase her burst's damage. 
    * Buffs that work for **Lightfall Sword** under her Alt-Swap + LFS timer include Rosaria A4, Bennett Burst, 4NO, Lisa A4, Shenhe A4, TTDS, and Zhongli shred.
  * Rosaria's [**Shadow Samaritan**](rosaria.md#ascension-passives) \(A4\), does not consistently last to the end of Eula's burst when immediately activated before Eula's burst. 
* **Glacial Illumination**'s cooldown and energy is reset at hitmark, not cast. 
* **Glacial Illumination** cast and **Lightfall Sword** are both considered blunt attacks
* The duration of **Glacial Illumination** cannot be increased by hitlag.
* **Lightfall stacks** are independent of enemies hit, meaning hitting multiple enemies will not net more stacks compared to hitting one enemy.
* The initial hit of Eula's Q does not grant a **Lightfall Stack**.
* Eulaâ€™s **Lightfall Sword** damage can be blocked by both [wooden](https://imgur.com/a/bL0UttC) and [Geo](https://imgur.com/a/PU9gkvv) Mitachurl shields.
* NA multihits, Hold E Icewhirls, and A1 sword remnant add 1 **Lightfall Stack** for each damage instance.
* Ranges \(1 abyss tile is ~2.55m\)
  * **Glacial Illumination**'s cast range: ~8 meters
  * **Lightfall Sword** explosion range: ~7 meters

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## **Ascension Passives**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Passive" %}
### **Aristocratic Introspection**

When Eula crafts Character Talent Materials, she has a 10% chance to receive double the product.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 1" %}
### **Roiling Rime**

If 2 stacks of **Grimheart** are consumed upon unleashing the Holding Mode of **Icetide Vortex**, a **Shattered Lightfall Sword** will be created that will explode immediately, dealing 50% of the basic Physical DMG dealt by a Lightfall Sword created by **Glacial Illumination**.

**Notes**
* The damage dealt by **Shattered Lightfall Sword** scales with **Glacial Illumination**'s talent level.
* This damage is considered Elemental Burst damage and is buffed by the effects of 2NO.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 4" %}
### **Wellspring of War-Lust**

When **Glacial Illumination** is cast, the CD of **Icetide Vortex** is reset and Eula gains 1 stack of **Grimheart**.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## **Constellations**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="C1" %}
### **Tidal Illusion**

Every time **Icetide Vortex**'s **Grimheart** stacks are consumed, Eula's Physical DMG is increased by 30% for 6s.
Each stack consumed will increase the duration of this effect by 6s up to a maximum of 18s.

**Notes**
* Whenever you consume a Grimheart stack, no matter the amount of stacks consumed, the duration of C1 will last a base of 6 seconds + 6 per Grimheart stack.
  * So one stack is 12s and two is 18s
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C2" %}
### **Lady of Seafoam**

Decreases the CD of **Icetide Vortex**'s Holding Mode, rendering it identical to Press CD.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C3" %}
### **Lawrence Pedigree**

Increases the Level of **Glacial Illumination** by 3.
Maximum upgrade level is 15.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C4" %}
### **The Obstinacy of One's Inferiors**

**Lightfall Swords** deal 25% increased DMG against opponents with less than 50% HP.

* This effect is additive and applies to both her Lightfall Sword from **Glacial Illumination** \(Burst\) and the Lightfall Remnants from **Roiling Rime** \(A1\).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C5" %}
### **Chivalric Quality**

Increases the Level of **Icetide Vortex** by 3.
Maximum upgrade level is 15.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C6" %}
### **Noble Obligation**

**Lightfall Swords** created by **Glacial Illumination** start with 5 stacks of energy. Normal Attacks, Elemental Skills, and Elemental Bursts have a 50% chance to grant the **Lightfall Sword** an additional stack of energy.
