* The auto-aim range for her normals is around 6 abyss tiles (~15.3 meters)

**Aimed Shot**  
Performs a more precise Aimed Shot with increased DMG.

While aiming, flames will accumulate on the arrowhead before being fired off as an attack.  
• Charge Level 1: Fires off a flaming arrow that deals Pyro DMG.  
• Charge Level 2: Generates a maximum of 3 **Kindling Arrows** based on time spent charging, releasing them as part of this Aimed Shot. Kindling Arrows will home in on nearby opponents, dealing Pyro DMG on hit.

| String | Talent 9% | Frames | MV/s | GU | Poise Damage | Impulse Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Aimed Shot | 80.58% | 15 | 322.32%/s | - | 10 \(Headshot: 30\) | 2 |

| With Recovery | - | 114, 132, 150 | 125.62%/s, 121.16%/s, 117.78%/s | - |

* Charged Attack frame counts are done using by holding and releasing the Normal Attack button.
* Regular Charge Level 2 arrows have Impulse Type 2 and headshots have 5, Poise Damage is the same as Charge Level 1.
* **Kindling Arrows** last around 2.5 seconds, don't drop off like regular arrows, and have auto lock aiming at a semi wide range.
* Yoimiya can have all three **Kindling Arrows** up after **Niwabi Fire Dance** ends, so long as the required charging time is met.
* **Kindling Arrows** are affected by Amos' Bow's passive and reach max stacks at low range.

**Plunge Attacks**  
Fires off a shower of arrows in mid-air before falling and striking the ground, dealing AoE DMG upon impact.

| String | Talent 9% | Poise Damage | Impulse Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Plunge DMG | 104.41% | 10 | 2 |
| Low Plunge DMG | 208.11% | 50 | 2 |
| High Plunge DMG | 260.76% | 100 | 3 |

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Niwabi Fire-Dance" %}
Yoimiya waves a sparkler and causes a ring of saltpeter to surround her. 

**Niwabi Enshou**  
During this time, arrows fired by Yoimiya's Normal Attack will be **Blazing Arrows**, and their DMG will be increased and converted to Pyro DMG. During this time, Normal Attack: Firework Flare-Up will not generate Kindling Arrows at Charge Level 2. This effect will deactivate when Yoimiya leaves the field.

| Attribute | Skill | 
| :--- | :--- |
| Blazing Arrow DMG \(T9%\) | 158.79% Normal Attack DMG |
| Particles | 1 (-) per proc |
| Frames | 23 |
| GU | 1A |
| ICD | 3 hit / 2.5s |
| Damage Element | Pyro |
| Damage Type | Normal Attack |
| Duration | 10s |
| CD | 18s |
| Poise Damage | 60 |
| Impulse Type | 3 |

**Notes**
* The Damage Bonus from **Niwabi Fire-Dance** is multiplicative.
* Yoimiya's particle generation triggers on infused arrow hit and has an ICD of 2s on particle generation.
  * Yoimiya's particle generation procs cannot be buffered, so Yoimiya will ideally generate 4 particles over the duration of **Niwabi Fire-Dance**
* Charged Shots during the duration of **Niwabi Fire-Dance** do not generate particles.
* Yoimiya can still produce energy even after **Niwabi Fire-Dance** expires as long as the ICD is off CD and the infused normal attack string arrow lands.

**Interactions**
* Yoimiya's **Niwabi Fire-Dance's Blazing Arrow** DMG increase does not increase Yun Jin's **Cliffbreaker's Banner** bonus.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ryuukin Saxifrage" %}
Yoimiya leaps into the air along with her original creation, the "**Ryuukin Saxifrage**," and fires forth blazing rockets bursting with surprises that deal AoE Pyro DMG and mark one of the hit opponents with **Aurous Blaze**.

**Aurous Blaze**  
All Normal/Charged/Plunging Attacks, Elemental Skills, and Elemental Bursts by any party member other than Yoimiya that hit an opponent marked by **Aurous Blaze** will trigger an explosion, dealing AoE Pyro DMG.  
When an opponent affected by **Aurous Blaze** is defeated before its duration expires, the effect will pass on to another nearby opponent, who will inherit the remaining duration.  
One **Aurous Blaze** explosion can be triggered every 2s. When Yoimiya is down, **Aurous Blaze** effects created through her skills will be deactivated.

### **Tricks of the Trouble-Maker**

During **Niwabi Fire-Dance**, shots from Yoimiya's Normal Attack will increase her **Pyro DMG Bonus** by 2% on hit. This effect lasts for 3s and can have a maximum of 10 stacks.

**Notes**
* Stacks gained from **Tricks of the Trouble-Maker** do not have independent durations, each Normal Attack hit will refresh the duration of all stacks to 3s.
* The Pyro DMG Bonus from **Tricks of the Trouble-Maker** can last up to 3s after **Niwabi Fire-Dance** ends.
* Gaining stacks will cause the orbitting sparks from **Niwabi Fire-Dance** to increase in brightness.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 4" %}
### **Summer Night's Dawn**

Using **Ryuukin Saxifrage** causes nearby party members (not including Yoimiya) to gain a 10% ATK increase for 15s. Additionally, a further ATK Bonus will be added on based on the number of "Tricks of the Trouble-Maker" stacks Yoimiya possesses when using **Ryuukin Saxifrage**. Each stack increases this ATK Bonus by 1%.
