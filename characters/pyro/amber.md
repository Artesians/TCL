{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Explosive Puppet" %}
The ever-reliable Baron Bunny takes the stage.

**Baron Bunny**  
• Continuously taunts the enemy, drawing their fire.  
• **Baron Bunny**'s HP scales with Amber's Max HP.  
• When destroyed or when its timer expires, **Baron Bunny** explodes, dealing AoE Pyro DMG.

**Hold**  
Adjusts the throwing direction of Baron Bunny.  
The longer the button is held, the further the throw.

| Effect | Skill |
| :--- | :--- |
| Explosion DMG \(T9%\) | 209.44% |
| Inherited HP \(T9%\) | 70.31% |
| Particles | 4 \(-\) |
| Frames | 35 |
| GU | 2B |
| ICD | None |
| Snapshot | Snapshots |
| Damage Element | Pyro |
| Damage Type | Skill | 
| Duration | 8s |
| Cooldown | 15s |

**Notes**
* The explosion has the blunt attribute that lets it damage shields and shatter frozen enemies like claymores.
* **Baron Bunny** can be picked up by Anemo units like Jean and Sucrose when they use their elemental skills.
* The explosion radius is smaller than the animation so take care when aiming it.
* Baron Bunny is allowed to have a hydro or cryo aura, as well as be frozen. 
  * Only environmental effects may apply the hydro aura. 
  * Most reactions function properly on this aura, notably: crystalize, swirl, superconduct, and shatter.
* Multiple Baron Bunnies can be spawned without C4 when utilizing cooldown reduction effects.
* **Baron Bunny**'s duration starts when it lands, not when the Skill is casted.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Fiery Rain" %}
Fires off a Shower of arrows, dealing AoE Pyro DMG in a Burst.

| Effect | Burst |
| :--- | :--- |
| Wave DMG \(T9%\) | 47.74% |
| Total DMG \(T9%\) | 859.25% \(18 Waves\) |
| Frames | 135 |
| GU | 1A |
| ICD | 3 hits / 2.5s |
| Snapshot | Snapshots |
| Damage Element | Pyro |
| Damage Type | Burst |
| Energy Cost | 40 |
| Duration | 2s |
| CD | 12s |

**Notes**
* Applies 1A worth of pyro 6 times, following normal ICD rules.
* Does 18 waves total over 2 seconds in the center of the AoE.
* 8 of the waves cover approximately the outer half the size of the marker.
* 10 waves cover the inner half of the marker.  
* Anything in the outer half is expected to get hit a random number of times, with closer to the edge being lower in the number of hits.
* The random arrow distribution in Amber's burst makes the reaction potential of her burst as the trigger very inconsistent.
