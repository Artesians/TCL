{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Guide to Afterlife" %}
Only an unwavering flame can cleanse the impurities of this world.  
Hu Tao consumes a set portion of her HP to knock the surrounding enemies back and enter the Paramita Papilio state.

**Paramita Papilio**  
• Increases Hu Tao's ATK based on her Max HP at the time of entering this state. ATK Bonus gained this way cannot exceed 400% of Hu Tao's Base ATK.  
• Converts attack DMG to Pyro DMG, which cannot be overridden by any other elemental infusion.  
• Charged Attacks apply the **Blood Blossom** effect to the enemies hit.
• Increases Hu Tao's resistance to interruption.

**Blood Blossom**  
Enemies affected by **Blood Blossom** will take Pyro DMG every 4s. This DMG is considered Elemental Skill DMG.  
Each enemy can be affected by only one **Blood Blossom** effect at a time, and its duration may only be refreshed by Hu Tao herself.

**Paramita Papilio** ends when its duration is over, or Hu Tao has left the battlefield or fallen.

| Attribute | Paramita Papilio |
| :--- | :--- |
| ATK Increase \(T6%\) | 5.06% Max HP |
| Activation Cost | 30% Current HP |
| Particles | 2~3 \(3:2\) |
| Frames | 42 |
| Infusion Element | Pyro |
| Duration | 9s |
| Cooldown | 16s |

| Attribute | Blood Blossom |
| :--- | :--- |
| Blood Blossom DMG \(T6%\) | 89.6% |
| GU | 1A |
| ICD | 3 hit / 2.5s |
| Snapshot | Dynamic |
| Damage Element | Pyro |
| Damage Type | Skill |
| Blood Blossom Duration | 8s |

**Notes**
* Blood Blossom tick rate is effected by hitlag. \(+1s\)
* Elemental particles are generated by pyro infused attacks during **Paramita Papilio**
  * There is a 5-second ICD between instances of particle production
  * Meaning, ideally Hu Tao will generate particles twice while infused
* Paramita Papilio can be extended with hitlag.
* When entering Paramita Papilio the knockback will cause the Illusory Bubble from Mona's Stellaris Phantasm to be removed and the Omen debuff applied even though no damage was done.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Spirit Soother" %}
Hu Tao commands a blazing spirit to attack, dealing Pyro DMG in a large AoE.

* Upon striking the enemy, regenerates a percentage of Hu Tao's Max HP. This effect can be triggered up to 5 times, based on the number of enemies hit. 
* If Hu Tao's HP is below or equal to 50% when the enemy is hit, both the DMG and the HP Regeneration are increased.

| Attribute | Burst |
| :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG (T6%) | 399.52% |
| Low HP Skill DMG (T6%) | 499.4% |
| Skill HP Regeneration (T6%) | 8.25% Max HP |
| Low HP Skill Regeneration (T6%) | 11% Max HP |
