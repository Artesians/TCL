# Frames

## Hitlag

Hitlag occurs whenever a character hits a target, frames get frozen to give the player a sense of "weight" behind each attack. The amount of hitlag depends on the target hit. Ranged characters and skills aren't affected by hitlag.  

## Hitlag Extension

Hitlag can effect both buff durations and aura durations. By hitting enemies, we can extend the duration of some effects, such as:

* Razor's [Lightning Fang](../characters/electro/razor.md\#attacks)
* Xiao's [Bane of All Evil](../characters/anemo/xiao.md\#attacks)
* The auras of Electro-Charged.

There are some skills, namely deployables, unable to be extended by hitlag, known instances include:

* Bennett's [Inspiration Field](../characters/pyro/bennett.md\#attacks)
* Chongyun's [Chonghua Frost Field](../characters/cryo/chongyun.md\#attacks)
* Xiangling's [Pyronado](../characters/pyro/xiangling.md\#attacks)

## Catalyst N1 Buffer

All catalyst characters have 3 distinct lengths for their n1. Under normal circumstances, they will always use their regular (short) version. However, inputting a Normal Attack immediately out of a dash or sometimes on the first few frames of a walk input will lead to the N1 having significantly increased animation frames (long version). Inputting a Normal Attack out of a previous Normal Attack string leads to a slightly lengthened animation (medium version). 
* For more detailed information and specific frame counts, see the [vault entry](../evidence/combat-mechanics/frames.md\#catalyst-n1-buffer).

## Burst Idle iFrames

Certain characters' elemental bursts provide iFrames far beyond the first cancellable frame. However, these iFrames are only active until the player inputs any action, after which they are immediately cancelled.
