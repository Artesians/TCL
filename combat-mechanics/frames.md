# Frames

## Hitlag

Hitlag occurs whenever a character hits a target, frames get frozen to give the player a sense of "weight" behind each attack. The amount of hitlag depends on the target hit. Ranged characters and skills aren't affected by hitlag.  

## Hitlag Extension

Hitlag can effect both buff durations and aura durations. By hitting enemies, we can extend the duration of some effects, such as:

* Razor's [Lightning Fang](../characters/electro/razor.md#attacks)
* Xiao's [Bane of All Evil](../characters/anemo/xiao.md#attacks)
* The auras of Electro-Charged.

There are some skills, namely deployables, unable to be extended by hitlag, known instances include:

* Bennett's [Inspiration Field](../characters/pyro/bennett.md#attacks)
* Chongyun's [Chonghua Frost Field](../characters/cryo/chongyun.md#attacks)
* Xiangling's [Pyronado](../characters/pyro/xiangling.md#attacks)

## Burst Idle iFrames

Certain characters' elemental bursts provide iFrames far beyond the first cancellable frame. However, these iFrames are only active until the player inputs any action, after which they are immediately cancelled.
