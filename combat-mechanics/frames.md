# Frames

## Hitlag

Hitlag occurs whenever a character hits a target, frames get frozen to give the player a sense of "weight" behind each attack. The amount of hitlag depends on the target hit. Ranged characters and skills aren't affected by hitlag.  

## Hitlag Extension

Hitlag can effect both buff durations and aura durations. By hitting enemies, we can extend the duration of some effects, such as:

* Razor's [Lightning Fang](../characters/electro/razor.md#attacks)
* Xiao's [Bane of All Evil](../characters/anemo/xiao.md#attacks)
* The auras of Electro-Charged.

There are some skills, namely deployables, unable to be extended by hitlag, known instances include:

* Bennett's [Inspiration Field](../characters/pyro/bennett.md#attacks)
* Chongyun's [Chonghua Frost Field](../characters/cryo/chongyun.md#attacks)
* Xiangling's [Pyronado](../characters/pyro/xiangling.md#attacks)
