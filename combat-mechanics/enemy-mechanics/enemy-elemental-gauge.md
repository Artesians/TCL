# Enemy Elemental Gauge

Enemies apply Elemental Auras that use the same system as Elemental Gauge Theory for units. Enemy aura application is significantly more accurate due to the delay on aura icon when testing on enemies. In addition, auras on units will disappear immediately rather than flickering, and confirm the hypothesis that there is an 80% aura "tax."

## Geo "Aura" Interactions

Some enemies have Geo "auras", and when petrified by Zhongli's Elemental Burst they have the following properties:

* These enemies have a Geo symbol above them, which can appear above their health bars.
* The aura is completely inert, not even Crystallize can be triggered. But it can co-exist with other Elements.
* It is still possible to trigger Crystallize if the player applies Cryo, Electro, Hydro, or Electro followed by Geo.
* Geo attacks cannot apply this Geo aura.
* Zhongli Hold E doesn't deplete this Geo aura from Petrification.

## Elemental Nodes 

Elemental Nodes and Infusion Stones have a 3-Hit ICD per target.
