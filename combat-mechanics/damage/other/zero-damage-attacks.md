# Zero Damage Attacks

Zero damage attacks are attacks and abilities that deal zero damage to enemies or targets. Examples include attacks on immune enemies, attacks on shields that nullify all damage (e.g. Abyss Mage shield, Lector shield, Mitachurl shield), alternate sprints, certain parts of Elemental Skills and Bursts (e.g. Hu Tao Skill, Xingqiu Burst), and Elemental Skill orbitals (e.g. Xingqiu Skill and Burst, Barbara Skill). 

For more information about the properties of these attacks, see the [Vault entry](../../../evidence/combat-mechanics/damage/other/zero-damage-attacks.md\#properties-of-0-damage-attacks).
