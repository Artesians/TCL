# Fatui

## Fatui Mirror Maiden

Can gracefully manipulate the Hydro Mirror, luring those enchanted by her to willingly fall for her illusion. Nothing can seem to escape her ears. It's not known what those covered eyes have seen, nor what kind of obsession will be reflected...

## Weakspot Details

* Mirror Maiden can be CCed, staggered, and yeeted by Jean during her "weak" state. Her teleportation can also be prevented during this tate.
* However, once the player got "marked" with the Refraction status, Mirror Maiden will enter the Polarization state, granting her new abilities as well as complete immunity to CC, stagger, and yeet by Jean.
* Some characters' skills & abilities can escape the Mirror Maiden's Glass Cage.

## Attacks

* When Mirror Maiden uses her teleport move, she will randomly teleport in front of the active character or behind him. There are no set patterns, it's pure random. This applies for both "weak" state as well as Polarization.
