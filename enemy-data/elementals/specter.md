## Specters

{% tab title="Anemo" %}
## Anemo Specter

As reason might dictate, monsters made from coalesced Anemo already come equipped with the ability to float. As such, their petal-like wings are most likely to be a mimetic organ first and foremost.

## Attacks

* Fury: Taking a lot of damage from a single attack will charge fury.
  * Stronger attacks charge more fury. 
  * When they have a full fury bar they will grow bigger and they do more damage.
* Shoots two consecutive homing wind bolts that do Anemo DMG. 
  * If at max fury, instead shoots three non-homing bolts in a spread pattern and becomes its' only attack.
* Spins, puffs up, then releases a swirl of wind dealing AoE Anemo DMG.
* Explodes after a short pause when defeated dealing AoE Anemo DMG. 
  * If at max fury, will instead create a Vacuum Field that sucks in players and deals Anemo DoT.
  * This attack is inevitable to happen, and negates the kill from the player, counting as killing itself instead, thus not activating any on kill effects (ex. the blackcliff weapon series).

{% tab title="Geo" %}

## Geo Specter

Geo Specters mimic the fruit of certain plants when their wings are closed together. As such, they are held by some ancient tales to be the fruit of a giant tree in the sky, and are regarded as having mysterious medical value.

## Attacks

* Fury: Taking a lot of DMG from a single attack will charge fury.
  * Stronger attacks charge more fury. 
  * When they have a full fury bar, they will grow bigger and do more damage.
* Shoots three small homing rocks that deal Geo DMG. The shots also knock the Specter backwards.
* Spins before knocking into the player, dealing Geo DMG.
* Shoots a projectile at the ground under it that bursts into an earthquake that deals AoE Geo DMG. 
  * This attack will only occur at max fury and will be the only attack it uses in that state.
* Explodes after a short pause when defeated dealing AoE Geo DMG.
 * This attack is inevitable to happen, and negates the kill from the player, counting as killing itself instead, thus not activating any on kill effects (ex. the blackcliff weapon series).

{% tab title="Hydro" %}
## Hydro Specter

On moonlit nights, Hydro Specters will give off a ghostly glow as they float by the riverbank. Their furtive forms are often mistaken by passers-by for wandering spirits, which has made them mainstays in quite a few folktales.

## Attacks

* Fury: Taking a lot of damage from a single attack will charge fury.
  * Stronger attacks charge more fury. 
  * When they have a full fury bar, they will grow bigger and they do more damage.
* Shoots a slow homing bubble that deals Hydro DMG.
* Spins before summoning a splash at the location of the player, dealing AoE Hydro DMG. Any enemies in the AoE will be healed by 33% of their Max HP.
* Squeezes itself out, before releasing a splash around itself dealing AoE Hydro DMG. 
  * This attack will only occur at max fury and will be the only attack it uses in that state.
* Explodes after a short pause when defeated, dealing AoE Hydro DMG.
  * If at max fury and enemies are nearby, the explosion will also release bubbles that track nearby enemies and heal them by 12.5% of their Max HP.
  * This attack is inevitable to happen, and negates the kill from the player, counting as killing itself instead, thus not activating any on kill effects (ex. the blackcliff weapon series).
