## Attacks  
* **Thunderbolt:** Summons a falling bolt of Electro energy to strike its foe. When below 50% HP it will summon 2 bolts consecutively. When its shield is active it will summon 3 bolts consecutively. The visual indicator for this attack will appear at the active character's feet.

* **Thunder Wave:** Conjures a wave of lightning bolts striking down in a line towards the player. When it's shield is active, it will unleash two waves of lightning at once, usually from different directions but sometimes in a straight line.

* **Thunderous Declaration:** When a character strays near to the Abyss Lector, it will implode itself with a powerful electromagnetic blast.

* **Storming Sanctum:** After falling to 20% health, the Abyss Lector will remove his remaining health to imbue itself with a powerful Electro shield. Breaking this shield will kill the Lector. Once the shield is activated, nearby players are knocked back from the Lector and damaged. The Lector also gains new/upgraded attacks when it is equipped with the Electro shield.

* **Abyssal Light:** Conjures 3 Electro orbs that launch towards the player's current position. If hit by these orbs, your energy will be depleted by a flat amount unless they're protected by a shield.

* **The Violet Lightning:** Summons many Electro orbs around it, after a short delay the orbs will be sent out in all directions and then stop for a second before exploding. This attack is only used when the Lector has entered the Electro Shield form. If hit by any of these orbs will drain the character's energy by a flat amount unless they're protected by a shield.
