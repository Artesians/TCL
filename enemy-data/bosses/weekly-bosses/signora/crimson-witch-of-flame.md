# Weekly Bosses

## Crimson Witch of Flame

The crimson dawn was reflected in her pupils, and at last, she unfolded her flaming wings and flew towards the light.
"But that light is not the dawn, dear Rosalyne. That is a sea of flame that will consume everything."
A voice spoke to her amidst the light.

Yet it mattered not, for she knew in her heart that the flames had devoured her long ago.

## Attacks

Now assuming her erstwhile moniker, Signora utilizes Pyro-based attacks. 
  * During this, Blazing Heat will accumulate rapidly. Once the gauge is full, the current player character will lose ~1% HP per second.
  * Eyes of Frost will be positioned at the edges of the arena to counter its effects.  

All of her attacks will cause Embered Earth: the floor will become molten for a short period of time, dealing Pyro DMG per interval.
  * Moreover, her attacks will also amplify the accumulation of Blazing Heat should the player gets hit by them.

* Uses a fiery whip to lash out the Traveler, dealing Pyro DMG. This attack comes in four variations:
  * A simple whip attack for close-range attack.
  * A two-lash combo with her whip.
  * A single strike in front of her.
  * A long-ranged attack which will leave out 3 flaming marks on the floor. The lashed-out floor will unleash fiery explosions as well.
* Signora hurls a large rolling dark fireball against the Traveler. This is usually done as a follow up to either The Witch's Wrath or Hellfire Onslaught.
* Teleports into a designated area to reposition herself.
* Signora unfurls her wings and rains down waves of molten rocks, dealing AoE Pyro DMG.
* Signora will unleash her wings to summon a flock of small hellfire butterflies in front of her.
* Signora summons a Hellfire Butterfly that homes to the player character.
* Signora spins herself to transform into a blazing tornado that moves around the arena. 
  * The tornado will also unleash 4 mini-tornadoes around it. 
  * At the end of the duration, Signora will spread her wings at the middle of the arena to unleash an intense heat along with another 4 mini-tornadoes, greatly accumulating the Blazing Heat status. 
  * This attack is usually done when her HP is low.
  * She will spend a very very very long time being invulnerable in this attack.
