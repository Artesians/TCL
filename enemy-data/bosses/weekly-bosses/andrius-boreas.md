# Weekly Bosses

## Andrius, Dominator of Wolves / Boreas, Great Wolf King of the North

When the wolfpack is imperiled, it will emerge in the form of a wolf and show forth its fangs and claws. The wolves of Wolvendom are frightening phantoms to the people of Mondstadt:A blurred shape flashing through the forest, a chilling howl in the indeterminate distance, the creeping sense of eyes constantly nailed to their backs... Humans rarely have the opportunity to lock their eyes with a wolf, for this is the law Lupus Boreas laid down for its race.

## Attacks

Andrius has 2 forms in which he will fight and a transition phase.  

### Phase 1
* Andrius jumps into the air and leaps toward the ice circle that appears on the ground.
* After charging for a while, Andrius will quickly dash towards the player, leaving an ice trail in his wake.
* Andrius raises his front legs and slashes towards his front.
* Depending on the player distance:
  * Melee: Andrius raises his hind legs and sweeps his tail quickly.
  * Ranged: Andrius raises his hind legs and sweeps his tail quickly while shooting small icicles towards the player.
* Andrius creates circular ice surfaces around him before spinning quickly (The actual range of slash is wider in front of him than behind him).
  * This move is an unblockable attack and cannot be dodged by dashing.
* After attacking his hind legs, Andrius will reposition himself to face the player.

### Interlude Phase:
* Interlude Phase is skipped if Andrius' HP is reduced to under41% in a single strike before the start of Interlude Phase
* Starts either once Andrius goes under 51% HP or enough time passed
Andrius runs in a circle around the map, and will charge towards the player when he stops (twice). Next, he circles the arena once again, then leaps to the middle of the arena.

### Phase 2  
Phase 2 is skipped if Andrius' HP is reduced to under 41% in a single strike before the start of Interlude Phase. Phase 1 abilities can still be used in this phase on top of new attacks:
* Andrius charges for a while and summons icicles that fall from the sky. The edge of the arena will be covered by an icy floor that deals Cryo damage if stood in.
* Andrius charges for a while and then roars, dealing continuous damage in a huge AoE around him.
* Andrius raises his front legs while creating an ice path in front of himself, then releases ice waves on the path.
* Andrius raises his front legs, then summons 3 vertical wind blades in a 60-degree forward arc.
* Andrius summons a small phantom wolf to attack the player. 
  * These will slowly escalate in appearance and attack speed as time progresses; when his HP falls below 20% or if the player take too long to defeat him.
