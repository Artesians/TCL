## Anemo Hypostasis - Beth

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/bosses/Enemy_Anemo_Hypostasis_Icon.webp)

Code name: Beth. A high-purity Anemo entity.Elemental hypostases are life forms which have completely abandoned their former appearance and biological structure, making them able to reach the highest level of elemental purity.Research into hypostases is mainly led by scholars of Sumeru Academia, but due to the level of danger that they pose, little of substance is known about hypostases beyond their scientific name and code name.

## Cryo Hypostasis - Daleth

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/bosses/Enemy_Cryo_Hypostasis_Icon.webp)

Code name: Daleth. A high-purity Cryo entity.Research suggests that there are subtle differences between elemental hypostases and other elemental life forms in terms of their physical composition. Perhaps these differences can account for their high level of homeostasis and their almost mechanical movements.

## Pyro Hypostasis - Ayin

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/bosses/Enemy_Pyro_Hypostasis_Icon.webp)

Code Name: Ayin. A high-purity Pyro entity. Elemental hypostases have the ability to often enter a sort of "emergency restart" phase when they are about to be destroyed and can revive themselves in this way. Such rapid regeneration is not possessed even by most creatures for whom survival is the top priority.
