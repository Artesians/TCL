description: A life-form created from condensed Hydro elements of incredible purity. Often attached to bodies of water.It is said that as water bodies become purer, the Hydro elements within grow more abundant, causing the Oceanids to grow more powerful. It is also said by some that Oceanids were once sea creatures from a home far away who carried the fragments of a long-dead god to the many corners of this world. Perhaps they did this so that the love their god held for this world could be spread through the waters to all the land...

## Attacks

* Is an airborne enemy that swoops at players from above, capable of dealing great knockback or poise damage.
  * As it flies, it's out of reach of most melee characters, but they can be hit by ranged characters. Abilities that have large (vertical) AoE or that increase one's vertical height can also help hit the raptors.
