## **Sucrose's N1 Attack can, in some Situations, Cease to Exist**

**By:** Mikman\#1149

**Finding/Bug:**

Sucrose's N1 attack can, in some situations, cease to exist. Sucrose will do her attacking animation, but no Anemo attack will be created.

**Evidence:**

There's a video linked showing the issue occurring at 0:02 and 0:19 [**https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tckURU3KAJmzCKvH-qVykY8DnXDWpIZg/view?usp=sharing**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tckURU3KAJmzCKvH-qVykY8DnXDWpIZg/view?usp=sharing)

**Significance:**

From what I can tell \(complaints about it on Hoyolab\), this has been in the game since launch. Attacking quickly with Sucrose will, in many instances, lose a significant portion of damage \(and more importantly Swirl potential\) because this bug is still in the game.

## **Can Sucrose's Normal Attacks \(and by extension, Swirl reactions\) trigger Fischl's Lightning Smite? \(Cola\#6861\)**

I was asked this question on reddit and thought it should be the case since Sucrose' basic attacks are anemo which will swirl the electro debuff on the enemy.

Upon testing, as expected: it works, and yes Lightning Smite also crits!

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**

One more reason to get Sucrose out in the field more often, at least for this use case

## **Gambler's 4pc effect can stack with sacrificial weapons to refresh two of sucrose's skill charges simultaneously**

**Significance:**

If running these together you should avoid triggering both while holding a spare charge. Might be good to know for some niche pure ER battery builds.

\[Also applies to other characters with charges\]

## **Sucrose A4 EM sharing does not benefit from Albedo's A4 EM sharing if Sucrose triggers hers before Albedo triggers his.**

**Evidence:**

* Albedo Q then Sucrose E: [https://imgur.com/a/KJ5Cp3E](https://imgur.com/a/KJ5Cp3E)
* Sucrose E then Albedo Q: [https://imgur.com/a/b3u2QhE](https://imgur.com/a/b3u2QhE)

**Setup:** a team comprised of an artifact-less 0 EM Childe, 0 EM Albedo, and a 154 EM Sucrose.

The final EM we expect from Childe and Albedo is determined by the ff formulas:

If Albedo's A4 is factored in Sucrose's A4:

&lt;Character's Base EM&gt; + 125 + \(&lt;Sucrose's Base EM&gt; + 125\) \* 0.2 = 180.8

If not:

&lt;Character's Base EM&gt; + 125 + \(&lt;Sucrose's Base EM&gt;\) \* 0.2 = 155.8

As we can see from the images, Albedo's A4 must be active when Sucrose triggers her A4. We can confirm it's not bc of any durations ending because Sucrose has the same EM in both scenarios.

**Significance:**

25 EM is lost if Sucrose triggers first which may be important in making rotations when min-maxing reaction damage.

## **Diona's Burst at Constellation 6 Stacks with Sucrose's Passive.**

**Evidence:**

[**https://imgur.com/gallery/nEtn6yK**](https://imgur.com/gallery/nEtn6yK) **\(pre-test stat\)**

[**https://imgur.com/gallery/aLVqfnT**](https://imgur.com/gallery/aLVqfnT) **\(Only A4\)**

[**https://imgur.com/a/2ljFQHq**](https://imgur.com/a/2ljFQHq) **\(A1+A4 while in Diona's Burst, sucrose on field\)**

**Significance:** This means if you pair Diona into your team, you can either stack even more Elemental Mastery towards your team as Sub-DPS, or you can allocate your Sucrose stats to DPS while not losing too much EM into the team. This only works inside diona's burst range, get out of it and the buff is gone. Also the other characters can get the additional 200EM increase if you switch on top of the stack buff.  
So in essence, diona's em stacks twice. Same theorem works for Albedo's burst as well and adding both of them altogether works too but as above, use albedo first.  
The above suggests the formula for final EM for a buffed party member after Sucrose’s A1 and A4 is  
50 + \[\(&lt;sucrose em&gt; + &lt;additional party em buffs&gt;\)×0.2\] + &lt;additional em buffs&gt;.
