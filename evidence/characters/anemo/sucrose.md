## **Sucrose's N1 Attack can, in some Situations, Cease to Exist**

**By:** Mikman\#1149

**Finding/Bug:**

Sucrose's N1 attack can, in some situations, cease to exist. Sucrose will do her attacking animation, but no Anemo attack will be created.

**Evidence:**

There's a video linked showing the issue occurring at 0:02 and 0:19 [**https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tckURU3KAJmzCKvH-qVykY8DnXDWpIZg/view?usp=sharing**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tckURU3KAJmzCKvH-qVykY8DnXDWpIZg/view?usp=sharing)

**Significance:**

From what I can tell \(complaints about it on Hoyolab\), this has been in the game since launch. Attacking quickly with Sucrose will, in many instances, lose a significant portion of damage \(and more importantly Swirl potential\) because this bug is still in the game.

## **Can Sucrose's Normal Attacks \(and by extension, Swirl reactions\) trigger Fischl's Lightning Smite? \(Cola\#6861\)**

I was asked this question on reddit and thought it should be the case since Sucrose' basic attacks are anemo which will swirl the electro debuff on the enemy.

Upon testing, as expected: it works, and yes Lightning Smite also crits!

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**

One more reason to get Sucrose out in the field more often, at least for this use case

## **Gambler's 4pc effect can stack with sacrificial weapons to refresh two of sucrose's skill charges simultaneously**

**Significance:**

If running these together you should avoid triggering both while holding a spare charge. Might be good to know for some niche pure ER battery builds.

\[Also applies to other characters with charges\]

## **Sucrose A4 EM sharing does not benefit from Albedo's A4 EM sharing if Sucrose triggers hers before Albedo triggers his.**

**By:** ioannesfifth\#1236 **Added:** 01/26/2021

**Evidence:**

Images are stored in:

* Base Stats: [https://imgur.com/a/pQW7ujK](https://imgur.com/a/pQW7ujK)
* Albedo Q then Sucrose E: [https://imgur.com/a/KJ5Cp3E](https://imgur.com/a/KJ5Cp3E)
* Sucrose E then Albedo Q: [https://imgur.com/a/b3u2QhE](https://imgur.com/a/b3u2QhE)

**Setup:** a team comprised of an artifact-less 0 EM Childe, 0 EM Albedo, and a 154 EM Sucrose.

The final EM we expect from Childe and Albedo is determined by the ff formulas:

If Albedo's A4 is factored in Sucrose's A4:

&lt;Character's Base EM&gt; + 125 + \(&lt;Sucrose's Base EM&gt; + 125\) \* 0.2 = 180.8

If not:

&lt;Character's Base EM&gt; + 125 + \(&lt;Sucrose's Base EM&gt;\) \* 0.2 = 155.8

As we can see from the images, Albedo's A4 must be active when Sucrose triggers her A4. We can confirm it's not bc of any durations ending because Sucrose has the same EM in both scenarios.

**Significance:**

25 EM is lost if Sucrose triggers first which may be important in making rotations when min-maxing reaction damage.

## **Diona's Burst at Constellation 6 Stacks with Sucrose's Passive.**

**By:** EggsD\#9603 and AngaFundarge\#4044

**Evidence:**

[**https://imgur.com/gallery/nEtn6yK**](https://imgur.com/gallery/nEtn6yK) **\(pre-test stat\)**

[**https://imgur.com/gallery/aLVqfnT**](https://imgur.com/gallery/aLVqfnT) **\(Only A4\)**

[**https://imgur.com/a/2ljFQHq**](https://imgur.com/a/2ljFQHq) **\(A1+A4 while in Diona's Burst, Sucrose on field\)**

**Significance:** This means if you pair Diona into your team, you can either stack even more Elemental Mastery towards your team as Sub-DPS, or you can allocate your Sucrose stats to DPS while not losing too much EM into the team. This only works inside Diona's burst range, get out of it and the buff is gone. Also the other characters can get the additional 200EM increase if you switch on top of the stack buff.  
So in essence, Diona's em stacks twice. Same theorem works for Albedo's burst as well and adding both of them altogether works too but as above, use Albedo first.  
The above suggests the formula for final EM for a buffed party member after Sucrose’s A1 and A4 is  
50 + \[\(&lt;sucrose em&gt; + &lt;additional party em buffs&gt;\)×0.2\] + &lt;additional em buffs&gt;.

## Sucrose C6 Buff Timer

**Finding:**  
The buff provided by Sucrose's Constellation 6 \(granting party members a 20% Elemental DMG Bonus based on which element is absorbed by Sucrose's burst\) lasts for 10 seconds.

**Evidence:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNVnsEdh29c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNVnsEdh29c)

The first test in the video establishes that the Sucrose in question has her Constellation 6 active, and that the buff arrows on Sucrose correspond to a 20% Pyro DMG Bonus from her burst absorbing Pyro from Guoba.

The second test shows that, as soon as Sucrose's Elemental Burst absorbs Pyro, Sucrose gets buffed, which lasts for 10 seconds.

The third test shows that even a late absorption of Pyro still results in a 10 second buff.

**Significance:**  
Teams with C6 Sucrose can plan their absorption time around when they want to utilize her 10 second buff window, either for snapshotting or for general team rotations.

## Sucrose C4 Mechanics

**Findings:**  
Remember that Sucrose C4 creates a 7 hit counter, where after 7 hits your E CD is reduced by 1-7s.

Sucrose C4 creates a 7 hit counter when the first normal/charged attack connects an enemy \(hitting the air does not create, nor further the counter\). However, this counter starts whether your E is on cooldown or not. If you do 5 normal attacks, then E and put your E on cooldown, you only need to do 3 more to hit the counter and get your cooldown reduced.

Switching characters does not delete this counter either, and it exists for a very long time, tested up to 30s, so guesstimate is 30s plus. Death also does not delete the counter.

The cooldown reduction hard caps at each charge's cooldown. If you get a higher reduction than the current E charge CD, it will reset, and not carry over to potentially 2nd charge's cooldown.  
Example: E is on 3s CD, you get a 5s CD reduction, you instantly gain E charge and timer start at 15s for the remaining charge.

Although the distribution does not fit nicely into the Gaussian curve, mean ~ 4s suggests there is no overly skewed cooldown reduction to either lower or higher bound, at large N.

**Evidence:**  
Switching character does not reset Sucrose counter: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q32IuH-Eu9g)  
Counter starts whether your E is on CD or not: [Video](https://youtu.be/Q2zyolyA8r0)  
Counter exists for 30s+: [Video](https://youtu.be/qTboBW3A7Qw)

**Significance:**  
This very slightly makes on field enabler Sucrose comps better, as swapping on Sucrose is very lenient + better understanding of Sucrose C4 RNG.

## Sucrose freeze and petrify burst interaction

**Findings:** Sucrose's burst normally pulls smaller enemies towards the center, and knocks back all enemies with each pulse. Freeze and petrify prevents the knockback but does not prevent the SUCC on smaller enemies.

**Evidence:**

* Example on smaller enemies: [Link](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/839639101825089556/839639647784927252/Genshin_Impact_2021.05.06_-_00.56.09.05.mp4)  
* Example on larger enemy: [Link](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/839639101825089556/839639679774883840/Genshin_Impact_2021.05.06_-_00.59.11.06.mp4)
* Petrify: [Link](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/839639101825089556/839650961516527658/Genshin_Impact_2021.05.06_-_01.51.25.08.mp4)

**Significance:** Sucrose's Burst can be used in conjunction with freeze or petrify to group enemies very tightly together without knocking them away from the center.
