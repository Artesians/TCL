**Finding:**

Ningguang's Elemental Skill with her c2 activated has its effect put into cooldown when her E is used and the Sacrificial passive is procced, if the conditions were met to also proc her c2 effect \( Jade Shield present and broken by casting E \)

**Evidence:**

In the first example in the video, Ningguang's Elemental Skill is cast on an enemy, which procs the Sacrifical passive, resetting the cooldown. Then, it is cast again which destroys the original Jade Shield and procs her c2 effect resetting the cooldown.

In the second example, Ningguang's Elemental Skill is cast without any proc. Then, it is cast again \( with the previous Jade Shield present - destroying it \) proccing the Sacrificial passive, resetting the cooldown. Another cast of the Elemental Skill \( destroying the Jade Shield \) shows that the c2 effect has been put into cooldown, as it does not activate.

In the third example, Ningguang's Elemental Skill is cast without any proc. Then, it is cast again \( with the previous Jade Shield present - destroying it \) proccing the c2 effect and resetting the cooldown. It is cast a third time, which now procs the Sacrificial passive resetting the cooldown again.

**Significance:**

General knowledge on how these mechanics work, in reference to current or future abilities.

## Ningguang Burst Does Not Snapshot

**Finding:** Ningguang ult does not snapshot

**Evidence:** Barbara with TTDS swaps to Ningguang, then she waits ~9 secs and pops ult. As you can see the first few shards deal more dmg due to TTDS attack buff, the last few deal less damage due to buff being expired.

**Significance:** You can not snapshot, most importantly, Royal Grimoire crit stacks.
