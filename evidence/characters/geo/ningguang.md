## Ningguang Burst Does Not Snapshot

**Finding:** Ninguang ult does not snapshot

**Evidence:** Barbara with TTDS swaps to Ninguang, then she waits ~9 secs and pops ult. As you can see the first few shards deal more dmg due to TTDS attack buff, the last few deal less damage due to buff being expired.

**Significance:** You can not snapshot, most importantly, Royal Grimoire crit stacks.
