**Finding:** Using Itto burst during N1 hitlag gives Superlative Strength Stack.

**Evidence:** Video and timing: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/9duP3w3)  
Itto gains Superlative Strength stacks on the frame that the damage numbers appear. So, if you use an N1 outside of burst and cancel the hitlag with Q before the damage number appears, the game will give you an SS stack from a burst N1.  

As this is ping-related, players with very low ping will only have a few frames in which to cancel into the burst.

**Significance:** There are several combo variants for Itto, a main category being first rotation 0 stack combos. With this tech, you can gain a stack early and go into the higher damage 1 stack combos without sacrificing dps from the extra non-Ult N1. It also serves as QoL to reduce the number of combo variants to remember.
