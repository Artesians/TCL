**Findings:**  
In order to combat the increasingly toxic nature of the internet, cyberbullying and world hunger, we test whether Yunjin and Beidou can counter the Inazuma Cannon. We found that both Beidou and Yunjin can commit a counter against the cannon and prevent death. This is truly a joyous day for anti-trolling. 

**Evidence:**  
* [Video of Beidou Counter](https://youtu.be/ILqt0C64KL8)
* [Video of Yunjin Counter](https://youtu.be/8Q5S4wrqRFc)

**Significance:**  
Despite Ei's prominent ability in the use of machines and dolls, her country is horrifically prepared to combat the common vision users such as Beidou and Yunjin. It is of the recommendation of this court that the Vision Hunt Decree be reenacted to increase the overall efficacy of these cannons in Inazuma.
