## Skill Mechanics

### Dimensions of Albedoâ€™s Elemental Skill AoE

**Added:** 12/28/2020  
Submission By: HailCorporate\#2970

**Finding:**  
Albedo's E AoE is cylindrical and has a maximum height just over the elevator's height.

**Evidence:**  
Linked video showcases different flower positions on a wall and confirming if Albedo's E will proc. Attached Screenshot shows relative distance from a shadow on the wall.

There was no point where it was possible to proc E underneath the flower versus on the outermost part of the AoE supporting that it is Cylindrical and not Spherical.

**Significance:**  
It is possible to place Albedo's flower in an elevated position to avoid it getting destroyed.

**Further Testing:**  
I've experienced placing Albedo's flower on top of Electro Hypostasis' summons during its death phase and it remained suspended after the summon was destroyed. This may be replicated in Albedo + Zhong teams with Zhong's pillar however I cannot test this as I do not own Zhong.

### Albedo's Elemental Skill Snapshots

**Finding:** Albedo's elemental skill snapshots, meaning that damage for its entire duration is calculated when the skill is cast, so any buffs gained/lost after the skill is cast will not affect the skill's damage.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/BhfcSLmPW5s](https://youtu.be/BhfcSLmPW5s)

Albedo's skill does not get affected by Ningguang's Jade Screen buff, since Albedo cast the skill before walking through the screen.

**Signifiance:** Will help improve rotations to deal more damage. In rotations, Albedo should only cast his skill after getting buffed.

**Finding:**  
Albedo's Solar Isotoma procs the Transient Blossoms when enemies take damage (client-side).  

**Evidence:**  
Triggers offline (client-side) and from talents, reactions, and environmental damage - [YouTube #1](https://youtu.be/FpCKqikOCQA), [YouTube #2](https://youtu.be/Mw_9WIU4cdk), [YouTube #3](https://youtu.be/0VWD8izbYog)  

**Signifiance:**  
Albedo's on-damage effect appears to trigger client-side and from all sources of damage, unlike most other on-damage effects.  

## Burst Mechanics

### Albedo's Fatal Blossoms Snapshots when his E is cast, not his Q

**Finding:**  
Albedo's Fatal Blossom damage is based on stats snapshotted when his E is cast, not at the time of Q cast

**Evidence:**  
E without snapshotting Bennett Q: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/nU2rHRm)  
Fatal blossom damage (noncrit): 88  
E with snapshotting Bennett Q: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/cEimR22)  
Fatal blossom damage (noncrit): 503  

Stats remain constant in each scenario. Only difference is order of bennett Q and albedo E. Fatal blossoms in first clip deal 88 damage, while in the second they are 503.  
Specific Attack Calcs: [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k_BUIffVbN781YZ5eL9OT4IqIZjS6rTpg-Ejr2f7-DI/edit?usp=sharing)  

This is similar to Ningguang's Q, where the gems from the screen have their stats taken from the E's Screen.  

**Signifiance:**  
To maximize Albedo Q damage, E should snapshot any attack buffs, as otherwise the fatal blossoms will not gain damage. Also shows why in my testing, fatal blossoms do not gain mistsplitter stacks.

### A4: Homuncular Nature

#### Albedo A4 Triggers During Q Animation

**Finding:**  
Albedo's A4 buff starts in the middle of his Q animation when the Geo structure appears in front of him. The buff timer starts at the same time and ends 10s after.  

**Evidence:**  
* In [this video](https://youtu.be/1ICK11HGyBs), the buff indicator only appeared in the middle of the animation, once the structure appears in front of Albedo.  

* In [this video](https://imgur.com/a/xxeBaqj), the Burst animation started at 21f, and the buff indicators appeared at 105f, before the Burst animation ended \(whic takes a total of 96f\).  

The A4 buff lasts 10s from the time the buff indicator appears, this is true for both videos.  

**Significance:**  
This info can help in rotation crafting, where people would need to know how long Albedo's A4 Passive lasts, which is 10s after Geo structure from his Burst appears.
