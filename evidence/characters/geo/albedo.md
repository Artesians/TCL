## Dimensions of Albedoâ€™s Elemental Skill AoE

**Added:** 12/28/2020  
Submission By: HailCorporate\#2970

**Finding:**  
Albedo's E AoE is cylindrical and has a maximum height just over the elevator's height.

**Evidence:**  
Linked video showcases different flower positions on a wall and confirming if Albedo's E will proc. Attached Screenshot shows relative distance from a shadow on the wall.

There was no point where it was possible to proc E underneath the flower versus on the outermost part of the AoE supporting that it is Cylindrical and not Spherical.

**Significance:**  
It is possible to place Albedo's flower in an elevated position to avoid it getting destroyed.

**Further Testing:**  
I've experienced placing Albedo's flower on top of Electro Hypostasis' summons during its death phase and it remained suspended after the summon was destroyed. This may be replicated in Albedo + Zhong teams with Zhong's pillar however I cannot test this as I do not own Zhong.

## Albedo's Elemental Skill Snapshots

**Finding:** Albedo's elemental skill snapshots, meaning that damage for its entire duration is calculated when the skill is cast, so any buffs gained/lost after the skill is cast will not affect the skill's damage.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/BhfcSLmPW5s](https://youtu.be/BhfcSLmPW5s)

Albedo's skill does not get affected by Ningguang's Jade Screen buff, since Albedo cast the skill before walking through the screen.

**Signifiance:** Will help improve rotations to deal more damage. In rotations, Albedo should only cast his skill after getting buffed.
