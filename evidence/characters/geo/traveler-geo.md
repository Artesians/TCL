## Attack Mechanics

### Twins CA MVs Comparison

**By:** Fluffy\#5580  
**Added:** 04/10/2021

**Theory:** Lumine is better than Aether because her CA 2nd hit multiplier is higher.

**Evidence:** Attached will be 2 images of T6 AA talent pages. The first will be Aether and the second will be Lumine. Using these values, and counting frames, I found that Aether has higher MV/s on N1, N2, N3, and N1C than Lumine but less on every other AA combo. My findings are in this sheet: [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14WkH2fd3fvGpHjGO7_A8xCJTy92WZsq0SL-tfEqXoXw/edit?usp=sharing)

**Significance:** Although, I wouldn't recommend using AA for either MC, Aether comes out on top with shorter AA combos which would be more preferred combos anyway. This means that while Lumine has on multiplier higher than Aether's, her AA is still worse than that of Aether. It really shouldn't matter unless you play main DPS though, so play who you want.

**Finding:**  
Geo MC Starfell Swords can be manually detonated by over-capping on the maximum amount of Geo construct.

**Evidence:**

**Significance**  
Geo supremacy.

## Burst Mechanics

### Wake of Earth Blocks Geovishap Jump

**Finding:**  
The Geo Traveler's Elemental Burst walls block a Geovishap from being able to jump over it.

**Evidence:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipBK9T1Thz8)  
As shown in the video, a Wake of Earth wall inbetween the Geovishap and the player completely prevent them from being able to jump over it, stopping their jump at the wall's edge.

**Significance:**  
Enemy movement manipulation when using Geo Traveler in a team comp.

## Passives Mechanics

### A4: Frenzied Rockslide

#### Geo Traveler A4 counts as Normal Attack

**By:** Blank#4561

**Finding:**  
Anemo Traveler A4 counts as Normal Attack Damage.

**Evidence:**  

* [Youtube](https://youtu.be/JH6KsDqdsN8)
* ` .6 * 752 * (1 + .35) * .9 * ((100 + 80)/(100 + 85 + 100 + 80)) = 270.35`

**Significance:**  
Although a minor damage source, Geo Traveler's A4 Passive damage is increased by DMG bonuses towards Normal Attacks.

## Constellation Mechanics

### C1: Invincible Stonewall

#### Geo MC C1 activation after Cast

**By:** Vherax\#5321  
**Added:** 6/20/2021

**Finding:**
Geo MC C1 10% Crit rate buff becomes active after stone wall is created and does not affect the burst itself upon activation

**Evidence:**
[https://youtu.be/DBMJEKuABes](https://youtu.be/DBMJEKuABes)  
Video shows geo MC with c6 and >90% crit rate not critting on 3rd hit of his Q.
If the crit bonus applied to burst damage, it would be impossible to not crit.

**Significance**
- Geo MC's burst does not apply C1 buff to its own damage (unless a ring from previous burst still exists)
- With C6 the duration of ring is 20s (with 15s cooldown), so it should be possible to maintain the buff on subsequent burst activations. However, as proven, the first elemental burst used will remain unaffected by C1 crit rate buff.

### C2: Rockcore Meltdown

#### Geo Traveler C2 damage

**Finding:**  
Geo travelerâ€™s C2 damage instance is considered skill damage.

**Evidence:**  
Testing done by cartercr#4207

**Significance**  
Damage calculations for Geo Traveler

## Interactions/Synergies

### Multiple E Skill Resonance Can Hit 1 Target

**By:** The CEO of GEO\#7227

**Findings:** Resonating Geo Constructs with overlapping AoEs will multi-hit enemies

**Evidence:** *Twitch Clip lost to the sands of time*

**Significance:** Geo MC can make the most constructs on the game \(2 Meatballs which cap to 3 with Zhong Pillar, and 4 from Ult which don't count towards cap. This can turn small arenas into multi-hitting funzones.

### Geo Traveler triggers Mistsplitter NA Stack

**Finding:**  
Geo Traveler can trigger Mistsplitter NA Stack with Frenzied Rockslide (A4).

**Evidence:**  
[Youtube](https://youtu.be/YzFQnlViilI): Geo Traveler starts with 12% Geo Damage Bonus, and after procing A4, goes up to 20% Geo Damage Bonus.

## Synergies/Interactions

### Rockstep Tech

**Finding:**  
It is possible for Geo Traveler to jump directly from the ground to the top of the meteorite created by Starfell Sword \(E\), giving characters vertical advantage and allowing certain actions such as plunge attacks. This mechanic can also be used by other characters in the party.  

**Evidence:**  
* Basics:
    * [Rockstep](https://imgur.com/Hwqb8ng)
    * [Extended demo](https://imgur.com/0fMSoxw)
* This tech can also be used by other characters with better plunge multipliers:  
    * [Rockstep Swap: Noelle](https://imgur.com/mtTFyzo)
    * [Rockstep Swap: Extended Demo](https://imgur.com/IQhnQKD)
* Other variations follow the same principle of using the meteorite to obtain vertical advantage:  
    * [Rockstep: Reverse Plunge](https://imgur.com/pOLMBYd)  
    * [Rockstep: Calculated](https://imgur.com/zpTl4aE)
* Another variation follows up after using the rock as a shield from enemy attacks (such as ruin guard missiles). Do note that character height affects this one; the taller a character, the easier it is to perform.
    * [Rockstep: Phantom](https://imgur.com/uchHBjw)
    * [Extended demo](https://imgur.com/MY1epe1)
* It can have some fun applications too!
    * [GMC on Fire](https://imgur.com/QIzK4LH)
    * [Rockstep: Itto](https://imgur.com/8ApH0nb)
    * [Rockstep: Klee](https://imgur.com/SbT1b2b)
* More practical applications can include using the vertical advantage to force certain enemy actions.
    * [Mitachurl drops shield](https://imgur.com/usTvkF2)
    * [Ruin Hunter takes flight](https://imgur.com/pzZ9nU5)

**Significance:**  
This is a GMC\-specific tech that can be used by other characters. There's potential gain for characters that benefit from having vertical advantage over the enemies, and doing so can trigger certain enemy patterns that may be beneficial to the player.
