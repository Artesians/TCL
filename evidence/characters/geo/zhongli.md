## Fischl C6 does not always Proc on Zhongli's first Normal Attack

**Bug/Finding:**

Fischl C6 does not always proc on Zhongli's first normal attack. When chaining multiple Zhongli attack sequences together, after the first sequence, the c6 does not proc on the first normal of the subsequent sequences.

**Evidence:**

[https://youtu.be/\_hEXbDqPtfo](https://youtu.be/_hEXbDqPtfo), as we can see Zhongli's first normal attack in the second and third attack sequence does not proc a fischl c6 proc

Pausing between sequences \([https://youtu.be/QmN3a94XPBI](https://youtu.be/QmN3a94XPBI)\), and dash canceling after the sequence \([https://youtu.be/JBQUbJp0hks](https://youtu.be/JBQUbJp0hks)\) seems to avoid the problem and the c6 proc occurs as normal.

**Significance:**

Allows for more accurate DPS calculations when using Zhongli and c6 fischl together.

**Finding:** Zhongli c2 affects his own burst when casting as do the 15% DMG bonus from Geo resonance but not the Geo resistance down unless it is applied first.

**Evidence:** [This video shows the damage of his burst in specific circumstances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv9ZNUz5vHE)

* Burst with shield already applied: 48k
* Burst with no shield: 48k
* Burst with Geo resonance and no shield: 52k
* Burst with Geo resonance and shield: 52k
* Burst with Geo resonance shield and res down: 57k
* The shield is formed at the end of the burst animation.

**Significance:** For the highest damage apply the Geo res down before pressing Burst.
