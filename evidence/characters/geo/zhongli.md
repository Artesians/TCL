**Bug/Finding:** 

Fischl C6 does not always proc on Zhongli's first normal attack. When chaining multiple Zhongli attack sequences together, after the first sequence, the c6 does not proc on the first normal of the subsequent sequences.   


**Evidence:**

[https://youtu.be/\_hEXbDqPtfo](https://youtu.be/_hEXbDqPtfo), as we can see Zhongli's first normal attack in the second and third attack sequence does not proc a fischl c6 proc

Pausing between sequences \([https://youtu.be/QmN3a94XPBI](https://youtu.be/QmN3a94XPBI)\), and dash canceling after the sequence \([https://youtu.be/JBQUbJp0hks](https://youtu.be/JBQUbJp0hks)\) seems to avoid the problem and the c6 proc occurs as normal.   


**Significance:** 

Allows for more accurate DPS calculations when using Zhongli and c6 fischl together.
