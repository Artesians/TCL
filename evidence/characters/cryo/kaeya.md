## Kaeya's E Skill Does Not Need to Trigger Freeze to Generate Additional Particles

**Finding:** Kaeya's A4 is phrased as "Opponents Frozen by Frostgnaw will drop additional Elemental Particles." However, enemies don't actually have to be frozen by frostgnaw for the additional particles to be generated; as long as Kaeya's skill hits a frozen enemy, it will generate additional elemental particles.

In the video, Barbara triggers the freeze, and Kaeya's E skill drops 4 particles (it normally drops 2-3).

**Significance:** With freeze comps, you can cast Kaeya's skill whenever you want and still get the additional particles without having to make sure that Kaeya is the character triggering the freeze reaction.
