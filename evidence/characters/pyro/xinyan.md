## Xinyan burst procs sac-gs

By: Neptunya\#8291

**Finding:**
The shield C2 Xinyan creates on burst can proc Sac GS's passive.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**
More chances for sacrificial procs means increased chances to get more energy. Also, there's less worry if you want to pop skill when sac GS is on CD or if the passive doesn't proc at all, because burst can also proc sac GS if your Xinyan is C2. While you could in theory pop her shield at rave level 3 and wait around for the sac GS timer to tick and hit enemies with the pyro DOT; it might be better to just use her burst and get the guaranteed level 3 shield and stand around for those few frames you can't swap off.
