### Attack Attributes

* Gauges - [xf3#3123](https://imgur.com/a/cmgaCZm)
  * Level 1 Charged Shot: 1A
  * Level 2 Charged Shot: 1A
  * Kindling Arrows: 1A
  * Pyro-infused NA: 1A
  * Charged shot during Niwabi Fire-Dance: 1A
  * Burst initial hit: 2B
  * Aurous Blaze Explosion: 1A
* Energy Generation
  * Charged shot during E does not produce particles - [Steph#3614](https://imgur.com/yml32cI)
  * Yoimiya's particle generation triggers on-hit (ICD estimate is ~2s) - [Steph#3614](https://imgur.com/zUi3Gxq)
  * Yoimiya can still produce energy even after infusion expiry **as long as the icd is off CD and the infused normal attack string arrow lands** - [Steph#3614](https://imgur.com/L7RiFfc)
* Kindling Arrows
  * Yoimiya's Kindling arrows last around 2.5 seconds, don't drop off like regular arrows, and have auto lock aiming at a semi wide range. - [xf3#3123](https://imgur.com/a/l8wot7Y)
  * Yoimiya's kingling arrow can trigger a second overload if shot far away enough, because Kindling arrows travel long enough to bypass the 0.5s ICD of overload - [Bobrokrot#0111](https://youtu.be/rlEAqvFFAfQ)
  * Yoimiya can have all three Kindling Arrows up after Niwabi Fire Dance ends, so long as the required charging time is met. - nat#4502
    * [3 Kindling Arrows](https://youtu.be/XEAJ9ssLmv4)
    * [2 Kindling Arrows](https://youtu.be/G50c8wvMqL4)
* Yoimiya can consistently trigger fall damage utilizing overload reactions. - [Bobrokrot#0111](https://youtu.be/T4niW6uCsC0)
  * You have to trigger all 3 overloads across her NA string to do this, otherwise she can miss the target. Results may vary for other electro applicators.
* Yoimiya's auto-aim range for her normals is around 6 tiles (~15.3 meters) - [nat#4502](https://youtu.be/jUOaFM4R9AQ)
* Kindling arrows can home in on different targets. - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/sbQgjv8.mp4)  
* Kindling arrows have a limited range. - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/3bgYXfR.mp4)  
* Kindling Arrow tracking is curved making it possible to orbit around targets. - [Ravantier#4984](https://imgur.com/mtpNOud)  

#### Kindling Arrows Interaction with Amos' Bow

**Findings:**  
 Kindling arrows are affected by Amos' Bow's passive, and it is very easy for Kindling arrows to gain all 5 stacks because of how slowly they move.
 
**Evidence:**  
[Kindling Arrow affected by Amos' Bow's passive at various ranges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OAt8g15qkM&ab_channel=Ayzel)

**Significance:**  
Increases Amos' Bow value with a CA-oriented Yoimiya playstyle.
  
### Skill Mechanics

* Her infused arrows follow standard ICD - [Artesians#0002](https://imgur.com/lebjy1p)
* Yoimiya's Skill is Multiplicative - Ayzel#7399
  * [Yoimiya Stat Sheet](https://i.imgur.com/zEBS0cvh.jpg)
  * [Yoimiya Damage](https://i.imgur.com/3jaKFjV.png) (2090)
  * `2089 * 1.12 * 0.5 * 0.9 * 2.552 * 1.5879 * 0.4901 = 2091` (difference explained by hidden rounding from game)
    * 2089 = attack
    * 1.12 = 1 + damage bonus (0.12 from bow)
    * 0.5 = enemy defence multiplier
    * 0.9 = enemy resistance multiplier
    * 2.552 = crit
    * 1.5879 = normal ATK damage bonus from T9 Niwabi Fire-Dance 
    * 0.4901 = talent multiplier of T6 N1

### Burst Mechanics

* Burst doesn't snapshot - [xf3#3123](https://i.imgur.com/gQwo7gs.mp4)
* Burst follows standard ICD (3-hit/2.5s) - [ProfHugo#6478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcWfDIDdyEE)
* The initial hit of Yoimiya's Burst is an arrow, and can miss. - [Aluminum#5462](https://youtu.be/mBOPnKHIHtg)  
* Yoimiya's burst elevates her character position. - [Ori#5463](https://youtu.be/-QKEeCRe2Vw)  

### Ascension Mechanics

#### A1: Tricks of the Trouble-Maker

* Yoimiya's A1 passive can last up to 3s after E expires. - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/pIa4ptP.mp4)
* Stacks gained from Yoimiya's A1 do not have independent durations, each Normal Attack hit will refresh the duration of all stacks to 3s. - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/aItiOYk.mp4) and [nat#4502](https://youtu.be/ykg2reBFBDI)
* Viridescent Hunt's passive does not affect Yoimiya's A1. - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/aItiOYk.mp4) 
* Gaining stacks will cause the orbitting sparks from Niwabi Fire-Dance to increase in brightness. - [nat#4502](https://youtu.be/GdQM8qDQ6O8)

### Fluff

* Yoimiya is also one of the few characters whom NPC will cheer for when using elemental skill. - [itskhoi#0013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YkInN2GsUA)
