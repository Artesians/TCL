**Finding:**  
Two Baron Bunnies can exist simultaneously on C0 Amber.

**Evidence:** [Video](https://youtu.be/a3_6u2jdFsE)  
Test was done on Floor 1 of the Abyss with a 4-piece Gambler set. 

**Significance:**  
It is possible to spawn multiple Baron Bunnies at once without C4 Amber.

**Finding:**  
Baron Bunny is allowed to have a hydro or cryo aura, as well as be frozen. In the former case only environmental effects may apply the hydro aura. Most reactions function properly on this aura, notable crystalize, swirl, superconduct and shatter. It is not known how one may apply a pyro or electro aura to the Bunny, and the author could not find a way for the bunny to be electrocharged.

**Significance:**  
Baron Bunny may be used as an entity to hold certain auras.

## Amber Burst Overload Consistency

**Finding/Bug:** Amber ult with full EM gear vs Electro Hypostasis can sometimes deal 3 large chunks of damage due to Overload reaction and sometimes 4.

**Evidence:**

* Amber 3 overloads: [https://youtu.be/e1YCTAdjJ2A](https://youtu.be/e1YCTAdjJ2A)
* Amber 4 overloads: [https://youtu.be/vXttP0fBsM0](https://youtu.be/vXttP0fBsM0)

**Significance:** The random arrow distribution in Amber's burst makes the reaction potential of her burst as the trigger very inconsistent.

**Evidence:**  
Testing done by Peekays#2722 and minah#0853

Testing done by minah#0853  
Damage increases with 2gambler bonus, and does not increase when 4NO buff is activated after skill cast but before detonation - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKHwO8wz0U)

**Significance:** Damage calculations and rotation considerations for Amber
