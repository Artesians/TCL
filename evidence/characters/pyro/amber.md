## Amber Ult Targeting

**Finding:** Amber's Q likely does not land randomly in certain pre-determined areas.  
It is suspected that any enemies standing in the outer zone of Amber's Q are hit a random number of times (not fixed).

The exact mechanic is guessed to be as follows:

* 8 arrows with damage radius of 2.6 will fall randomly along a circle 2.6 units away from the center of the Q
* 10 arrows with damage radius of 2.6 will fall randomly in a circular area between 0 to 2.6 units away from the center of the Q

As such, anything outside of 2.6 units from the center (so approx. half way) is expected to get hit a random number of times, with closer to the edge being lower in the number of hits

**Evidence:** 

* [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9PTktXgK_B9Rb_4JWwXgQ-EBeR26QFpe)
* [Spreadsheet Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18JB0rZ8TA4nFt-vpwcmFbNFitqpM2XyLgo7WGGvrNmE/edit#gid=0)
* [G-Drive with full clips](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z9HYWda7DiBQngmjjxRronPbccrdkybe?usp=sharing)

Specifically in the f1 video:
* The slime at the very edge is barely touching amber's Q, and is hit 6 times. The outer edge AoE system as described by the theory hunt can be thought of as circle AoEs entirely enclosed within the circle of Amber's Q, and fixed to center exactly 2.6 units away from the middle of Amber's Q, as Amber's Q was described to have a radius of approximately 2.6 x 2, and each of her outer-edge AoEs land in a circle of 2.6 radius from the center of her Q.  
* The odds of this slime being hit randomly by entirely enclosed AoEs within Amber's ult 6 times out of 18, especially considering that 10 of the arrows have the entire inner circle of 2.6 to land in that would miss this outer slime, is close to 0.  

There is another example of this happening in 4c, when one of the slimes jumps in halfway through ambers ult, and with barely any of its hitbox entering her AoE, is struck 3 times

**Finding:**  
Two Baron Bunnies can exist simultaneously on C0 Amber.

**Evidence:** [Video](https://youtu.be/a3_6u2jdFsE)  
Test was done on Floor 1 of the Abyss with a 4-piece Gambler set. 

**Significance:**  
It is possible to spawn multiple Baron Bunnies at once without C4 Amber. 

## Baron Bunny's aura

**Finding:**  
Baron Bunny is allowed to have a hydro or cryo aura, as well as be frozen. In the former case only environmental effects may apply the hydro aura. Most reactions function properly on this aura, notable crystalize, swirl, superconduct and shatter. It is not known how one may apply a pyro or electro aura to the Bunny, and the author could not find a way for the bunny to be electrocharged.

**Evidence:** [Video](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPByPR2TubV5LHQ9Oab6k1bthvfrHkiSu)

**Significance:**  
Baron Bunny may be used as an entity to hold certain auras.

## Amber Burst Overload Consistency

**Finding/Bug:** Amber ult with full EM gear vs Electro Hypostasis can sometimes deal 3 large chunks of damage due to Overload reaction and sometimes 4.

**Evidence:**

* Amber 3 overloads: [https://youtu.be/e1YCTAdjJ2A](https://youtu.be/e1YCTAdjJ2A)
* Amber 4 overloads: [https://youtu.be/vXttP0fBsM0](https://youtu.be/vXttP0fBsM0)

**Significance:** The random arrow distribution in Amber's burst makes the reaction potential of her burst as the trigger very inconsistent.

**Finding/Bug:**  
* Amber’s C1 damage instance is considered CA damage.  
* Amber’s C2 damage instance is considered skill damage.

**Evidence:**  
Testing done by Peekays\#2722 and minah\#0853  
Damage increases with 4WT bonus - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKHwO8wz0U) and [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPVvaP6QUV4)  

Testing done by minah\#0853  
Damage increases with 2gambler bonus, and does not increase when 4NO buff is activated after skill cast but before detonation - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKHwO8wz0U)

**Significance:** Damage calculations and rotation considerations for Amber
