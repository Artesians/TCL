### Yelan Burst Wave Microsnapshot

**Theory:**  
Based on the [Xingqiu wave snapshot ticket](../../../evidence/characters/hydro/xingqiu.md#each-burst-wave-snapshots-when-summoned), Yelan’s Burst was investigated. Unlike Xingqiu, it seems the check for buffs is done per projectile, not per wave. Each Burst projectile snapshots after being generated.

**Significance:**  
Better understanding of how buffs interact with Yelan’s Burst, specifically noting that each of Yelan’s projectiles in a given wave can do different damage.
