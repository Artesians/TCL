## **XQ Q Sword Has an Internal Cooldown**

**By:** BowlSoldier\#3528  
**Added:** 12/6/2020

**Note**: This entry is outdated after further testing and new information about Internal Cooldowns was uncovered. For the most up to date conclusions on Xingqiu's ICDs, see [Xingqiu C6 3rd Wave Applies Hydro Twice](xingqiu.md#xingqiu-c6-3rd-wave-applies-hydro-twice)

**Finding:**

Each wave of XQ's swords applies Hydro only once, regardless of how many swords are in that wave.

**Evidence:**  
[https://streamable.com/1zf2lo](https://streamable.com/1zf2lo)  
[https://streamable.com/h3wn34](https://streamable.com/h3wn34)

In both of these videos, the sword wave only clears away the existing Pyro on the enemy. If each sword in the wave had a separate ICD, we would expect to see the 1st sword in the wave clear the Pyro, and the second sword would re-apply Hydro so the enemy should have a Hydro aura.

**Significance:**

There are some videos taken before 1.1 where the swords in each wave each seemed to have a separate ICD. This seems to have been fixed as part of the same patch that fixed XQ's orbital swords having a lower ICD after swapping. Let's be careful not to spread those old videos as misinformation.

## Xingqiu C6 3rd Wave Applies Hydro Twice

**Evidence:**

**Significance:** For vape comps with C6 XQ, every 3rd sword wave basically guarantees hydro aura. For EC comps, it makes it more likely for the electro to be the trigger. Generally speaking, it gives XQ greater hydro aura potential.

## **Xingqiu's Q Damage Calculation is Dynamic**

**By:** IonFox\#8887

**Theory:**

XQ ult is dynamic and not a snapshot.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/NEnRlMsQRVA](https://youtu.be/NEnRlMsQRVA) \(source : @Ashen Cenpi\)

XQ ult is cast and used against an enemy to determine a baseline.

* NingGuang holding 4 petra creates a hydro crystal and picks it up, granting the team 35% hydro damage.
* Hydro sword damage then observed to increase.

Note: Crystal is picked up after the 2nd wave of swords so hydro res shred from C2 already accounted for.

**Significance:**

XQ ult is dynamic and not a snapshot, buffs/value changes received after casting still affect damage. Previous interaction with dragonslayers is likely a result of the dragonslayers bug currently floating around.

## **Xingqiu E Double Vaporize**

**By:** Zeitraffer\#1074

**Finding:**

How to vaporize both of Xingqiu’s E slashes with either Gouba or Amber

**Evidence:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-03MNwss9UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-03MNwss9UI)

There are 2 methods of doing it. You can use Xiangling’s E and time it on Gouba’s attack. The easier method is by using Amber’s ult, you only need to cast E to do it.

**Significance:**

For one-shot \(or two-shot\) compilations, although I’m not sure if this team comp is better since you will lose Barbara’s E buff.

## **Xingqiu’s Rain Sword Damage Reduction does Snapshot**

**By:** wiremash\#0433

**Finding:**

Xingqiu's Rain Swords Do Snapshot

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/WJUepUXbVmo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJUepUXbVmo&feature=youtu.be)

Tested with C2 Barbara and compared the received damage with and without the Hydro buff.

**Significance:**

While Xingqiu's burst Hydro Swords are dynamic, the damage reduction from the Rain Swords is snapshot \(both E and Q\).

**Editor’s Note:**

Verified. Also, a similar instance occurs when using Streaming Essential Oil \(25% Hydro DMG% increase potion\), so we know it's not limited to just Barbara.

## Xingqiu E Dash Cancel Animation

**By:** Charliex3000\#9403  
**Added:** 03/18/2021

**Finding:**

XQ E dash cancel is faster than ult cancelling.

**Evidence:**

[https://youtu.be/olBKG1I3JEw](https://youtu.be/olBKG1I3JEw)

38 frames to dash cancel, 71 frames to ult cancel, 92 frames without a cancel to swap.

**Significance:**

Dash to swap is faster since it takes longer without a cancel to swap.

## Xingqiu Sword Rain "Buffering"

**By:** Charliex3000\#9403  
**Added:** 03/21/2021

**Theory/Finding/Bug:**

XQ ult wave comes out if you are in an auto animation at the time the ICD ends. It does not actually buffer.

**Evidence**:

[https://i.imgur.com/jNBiTa9.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/jNBiTa9.mp4)

* First set of 2: Click-&gt; wait 500 ms -&gt; click -&gt; wait 600 MS -&gt; swap
* Second set of 2: Click -&gt; wait 500 ms -&gt; click -&gt; wait 400 MS -&gt; swap

**Significance**:

Clears up how exactly "XQ buffers." Additionally pending some extra tests about how long the active window for an auto to proc rain swords it.

## Xingqiu Hydro Aura Persistence

**By:** Sayline\#5959  
**Added:** 04/05/2021

**Finding:** After Xingqiu's burst ends, there is a period where you can still imbue a hydro aura even if the orbitals visually disappeared. Upon further investigation, XQ's orbitals don't disappear completely, rather, they degenerate into particles of hydro that still appear around XQ for a set duration of time \(about 47 frames from the moment the swords blink before exploding until the last bits of hydro particles disappear\).

**Evidence:**

* [Vid 1](https://youtu.be/3UBplhXNPdc): I used XQ's burst here. Video was left to play a bit longer to show elemental aura gauge unit for "invisible" hydro aura \(it is 1A\).
* [Vid 2](https://youtu.be/sxnnMq8ljKE): I used XQ's skill here. Same "invisible" hydro aura is observed as with his burst.
* [GIF 1](https://imgur.com/8EDEVxu): Portion of Vid 2 where XQ orbitals break, magnified. Using this clip, I counted 47 frames for hydro particle persistence, starting from the moment the swords blink prior to shattering, and ending at the few frames when XQ imbues hydro on the ruin guard.
* [GIF 2](https://imgur.com/cmsVCV9): Slowed down version of GIF 1. Here, the hydro particles are easier to observe.

**Significance:** Limit testing of XQ.

## Xingqiu Rain Sword ICD

**Finding:**  
The hydro application of Xingqiu's orbital rain swords has an ICD of 2.5 seconds.

**Evidence:**  
[Rain sword triggers swirl](https://youtu.be/k2f2aAR4AS4) at 5:11, 7:41, 10:10 and also at 58:03, 1:00:32, 1:03:01, and 1:05:30

**Significance:**  
Better knowledge for teambuilding and rotations.
