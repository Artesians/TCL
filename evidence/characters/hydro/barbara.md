## Skill Mechanics

### **Barbara E Animation Cancel**

**By:** RoaringMeow\#2437  
**Added:** 12/19/2020

**Finding:**

Reducing Barbara E animation for optimizing the "first heal"

**Evidence:**

* Just Switch: [https://youtu.be/8d4SAxy2yrM](https://youtu.be/8d4SAxy2yrM)  
* Just Switch and Beyond: [https://youtu.be/yBNpbQNPVgg](https://youtu.be/yBNpbQNPVgg)

**Significance**

A mechanic which is super useful to abuse the switch character cooldowns while using character's E between delays. So far I found only Barbara being able to do it consistently

Steps to Reproduce

* Switch to Barbara
* Press the button to swap to another character and immediately spam E

**Finding:**  
Barbara has a small time window during her initial Elemental Skill cast that allows her to dash and cancel the Elemental Skill, while avoiding the cooldown and triggering 4-Piece set bonuses from artifacts.  

**Evidence:**

4-Piece Shimenawa's Reminiscence:  
* Unbuffed: 93 DMG  
* Buffed: 140 DMG  

4-Piece Heart of Depth:  
* Unbuffed: 98 DMG  
* Buffed: 109 DMG  

**Significance:**  
Potential improvement for Main DPS Barbara as you can now avoid her long Elemental Skill cooldown.

### C6: Dedicating Everything to You

#### C6 Revive Can Be Canceled by Switching

**Finding:**  
If a character dies at the same time the player switches characters, the death animation for the dead character will not activate, and neither will the revive from Barbara C6.  

**Evidence:**  
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/2BZSTCRNuJo)  
The death animation and revive activates for Qiqi, but not for Aloy.

**Significance:**  
Barbara C6 is potentially worse as a safety net against death since it can be canceled by switching, which is common in regular play.
