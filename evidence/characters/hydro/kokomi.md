## Skill Mechanics

* If Bake-Kurage disappears before its final tick hits an enemy, the game will not check for particle production on that hit.

  * 4pc Gamblers: [Mcpie#8672](https://imgur.com/ATtyo26)
* Kokomi's E resnapshots upon Q cast refreshing Bake-Kurage Duration. - [CC#5588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOQVxguTCVg)
  * 00:08 - proof of snapshot
  * 00:29 - Bake-Kurage damage changes upon Q cast
  * 00:53 - Bennett atk buff remained snapshotted even after E timer refresh (as shown by the final tick at around 01:16)
  * 01:28 - prematurely switching out of Kokomi during her Q results in Bake-Kurage bonus dmg from Q going away
* The Bake-Kurage damage bonus when Q is active does not get snapshotted by Bake-Kurage - [Aetherpon#5730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NmAZBZsTDk) and [CC#5588](https://youtu.be/hOQVxguTCVg?t=88)
* Kokomi E spawn has a fixed range. - [CC#5588](https://youtu.be/w2ouvQFhNkI)
* Kokomi's Bake-Kurage only heals the active character and if they are within the Bake-Kurage's AoE - [CC#5588](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8K8FUOai50)
* If Kokomi dies, Bake-Kurage still remains on-field dealing damage. - [CC#5588](https://youtu.be/gSYBPDn4B_E)
* Bake-Kurage healing has infinite vertical range. - [Doug#8888](https://youtu.be/TyJ-WuAFVVY)
* Bake-Kurage alone cannot cause infusion or be swirled off of. - [Mcpie#8672](https://imgur.com/2swgDRw)

* Kokomi cannot absorb pre-fed particles during her Elemental Burst animation - [Aetherpon#5730](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52NLl3LR2io)

## Passive Mechanics

### A1: Tamanooya's Casket

* The Bake-Kurage Duration refresh from A1 does not refresh Heart of Depths 4pc passive, because it does not count as a "using an Elemental Skill". - [CC#5588](https://youtu.be/usU2tJ7HQEs)

### A4: Song of Pearls

* The effects of A4 cannot get extended by buffering an attack right before her Burst duration ends. - [CC#5588](https://youtu.be/QavGQnCuodQ)
