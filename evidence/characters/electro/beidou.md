## Attack Mechanics

### Analysing Beidou’s Normal Attack Rotations Including Hitlag

**By:** lostguru\#5024  
**Added:** 12/6/2020

**Evidence:**  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txxpy3-lrYM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txxpy3-lrYM)

**Significance:**

1. You lose around 30% damage output without Lightning Storm active.
2. C0-C3 Beidous looking to maximize damage output will want to use 4-hit run cancels and full combo dash cancels.
3. C4-C6 Beidous can consider using 2-hit run cancel rotations when they want to prioritize Electro damage output.

## Skill Mechanics

### Frame Analysis of Beidou’s Parry

**By:** MemeMastodon69\#2165  
**Added:** 11/5/2020

**Finding:**  
Beidou perfect parry has 2 startup frames, 17 active frames +/- 1 frame

**Evidence:**

Input overlay to detect inputs, counting from 1 on the frame after the input is registered. Large slime's jump attack previously established to create an active hitbox on the frame that the "spark" effect appears as it hits the ground. All counts made between when the input overlay registers the input \(frame 0\) and the slime's first active hitbox frame. As always, results are fuzzy by +/- 1 frame due to discrepancies between game simulation and graphical rendering.

**Significance:**

Beidou's extremely strong potential burst damage is evidently achievable by many players, as the timing window is only marginally tougher than dodging. Serious consideration should be given to "gitting gud" and making use of Beidou burst DPS.

### Beidou E Particle Mechanics

**By:** Steph/\#3614  
**Added:** 03/22/2021

**Theory/Findings:** Beidou's Tidecaller particle production mechanic actually has no RNG assigned to it at all. It produce at base 2 particles, and every charge you gain on your tidecaller increases the particles produced by 1, capping at 4 \(2 charge\). In addition, Perfect Parry automatically provides 2 charges for particle production as well, in addition to damage, and if the skill were held after a perfect parry, even if you don't get hit at all, it will still be executed at max charge.

**Evidence/Testing:** A series of 100 E casts of each following category was executed

* [Tapping E without getting hit at all](https://imgur.com/rtJKoAe) \(to simulate a no charge tidecaller\)
* [Holding E for at least half a second](https://imgur.com/0UGRrti) \(to make sure that it's not a perfect parry\) before getting hit, then get hit only once before release the E right after \(to simulate 1 charge\)
* [Holding E for at least half a second](https://imgur.com/Yr8KJNr) \(to make sure that it's not a perfect parry\) before getting hit, then get hit at least twice before releasing the E after \(to simulate 2/full charge\)
* [Tap E on enemy's attack](https://imgur.com/ppUAnWq) \(to simulate perfect parry\)

**Results:**

* 0 charge tidecaller will always produce 2 electro particles
* 1 charge tidecaller will always produce 3 electro particles
* 2 charge tidecaller and perfect parries will always produce 4 electro particles

**Significance:** This makes Beidou's particle production way easier to count.

## Burst Mechanics

### Beidou's Q snapshot timing

**By:** EdisonsMathsClub#6469  
**Added:** 09/22/2020  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888775921845280788/890112499628777532/transcript-beidou-q-snapshot-timing.html)

**Finding:**  
Beidou's Elemental Burst, Skill DMG and Lightning DMG, snapshot at different timings.

**Evidence:**  
Test timings of Beidou's Burst inside Bennett ultimate, both intentionally waiting for the Bennett ATK Buff and casting Burst, and intentionally quick swapping to not snapshot the Bennett ATK Buff and casting burst.

[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g14YmgMUzv0): Snapshot, Skill DMG 16921, Lightning DMG 13359

[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DPqbdoxX8I): No snapshot, Skill DMG 16444, Lightning DMG 8906  
(The difference of the Skill DMG is due to losing 1 stack of Serpent Spine.)

In both clips, the Skill DMG snapshots Beidou's stats when it hits, when she has the Bennett ATK Buff. However in the no snapshot clip, as Beidou's Lightning DMG snapshots instantly on cast, and thus, the no snapshot clip has less Lightning DMG.  

**Significance:**  
In the dire circumstance that you cast Beidou's Elemental Burst too fast to snapshot the Lightning DMG, you still salvage some damage as the Skill DMG snapshots later. It is still best to wait for the buffs to appear, to buff both Skill and Lighting DMG.

### C4: Stunning Revenge

#### Mistranslation of Beidou’s C4 Effect

**By:** EternalDream\#5503  
**Added:** 12/7/2020

**Finding:**  
Beidou’s C4 is mistranslated:

* Current description, Within 10s of taking DMG, Beidou's Normal Attacks gain 20% additional Electro DMG.
* Correct description, Within 10s of taking DMG, Beidou's Normal Attacks AND CHARGED ATTACKS gain 20% additional Electro DMG.

**Evidence:**

* [C4 Effects](https://puu.sh/GSOeX/499a6b1506.png)

* [Youtube](https://youtu.be/0LfX9j2nAd8)

**Significance:**

C4 is not anti-synergistic with all her charged attack bonuses, as one would assume from the description.

**Finding:**  
Beidou’s C4 damage instance has no ability type scaling tags.

**Evidence:**  
Damage is consistent with and without 4HoD bonus - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h519mCwngYU)  
Damage is consistent with and without 2gambler bonus - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDvtbFJz0Mo) and [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOTjyTs34Gw)  
Damage is consistent with and without 2NO bonus - [VIdeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khas559DcQs) and [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ritlIZQlWpg)  

**Significance:**  
Damage calculations for Beidou.

#### Beidou C4 is on hit not damage

**By:** Bobrokrot#0111  
**Added** 09/10/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/884807649869324348/885685498985738240/transcript-beidou-c4-is-on-hit-not-damage.html)

**Finding:**  
Beidou's C4 is actually on hit, not damage. It does activate when you get hit but don't take damage (if you are shielded).

**Evidence:**  
[Youtube](https://youtu.be/_C0Xp0gROk0): Here Beidou blocks rockets with her parry, C4 is activated.

[Youtube](https://youtu.be/VrRdG2NUv4Q): It applies not just to Beidou's shield but presumably all shields. In this instance it does work with Noelle's shield.

**Significance:**  
C4 pretty good

## Interactions/Synergies

### Serpent Spine Interactions with Beidou

**By:** ZΛNTO\#4984  
**Added:** 12/13/20

**Finding:**

Everything you need to know about Serpent Spine and Beidou

1. Perfect parrying does NOT reduce your Serpent Stacks. Any shield damage will not count as "taking damage," but if your shield breaks from an attack it WILL count as taking damage.
2. Serpent stacks still boost damage when off-field
3. Stormbreaker is SNAPSHOTTED, meaning casting it will "lock" your stats. Losing or gaining any stacks will NOT change your current Burst damage.

**Evidence:**

1. [https://streamable.com/aq33mj](https://streamable.com/aq33mj)  Notice how I start and end the parry with 5 stacks.
2. [https://streamable.com/3qsmmj](https://streamable.com/3qsmmj)  3523 crit damage on and off-field.
3. [https://streamable.com/f6836w](https://streamable.com/f6836w)  1766 non-crit at 3 stacks, 1766 non-crit at 5 stacks

**Significance:**

Good weapon. Works as well as you'd expect.

### Beidou C4 interaction with Sara

**By:** Bobrokrot#0111  
**Added** 09/06/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/883625161058844702/884468275151511612/transcript-sara-beidou-c4-interaction.html)

**Finding:**  
Sara's Tengou Juurai: Ambush activates Beidou's C4 when it hits (buffs) Beidou.

**Evidence:**  
[Video](https://youtu.be/oYDHcC2prLY): In this video you can see that Beidou's weapon is normal and after she gets hit by Tengou Juurai: Ambush her weapon starts sparking with electro, indicating that C4 has been activated. 

**Significance:**  
Neat interaction for Beidou

### Does The Bell’s passive affect Beidou’s Elemental Skill DMG?

**By:** Elliotto\#6694  
**Added:** 11/18/2020

**Finding:**  
The passive on The Bell \(4\*\), influences Beidou’s damage on Tidecaller \(E Counter\).

**Evidence:** *Twitch Clip lost to the sands of time*

* Damage with The Bell: 111
* Damage with a weapon of same Base ATK: 98

\(In addition, the total amount of shields does not increase the percentage of damage bonus from Bell's passive. This was tested through a similar method, using Diona, Crystalize, Noelle, and Beidou shield at the same time. The damage remained consistent\)

**Significance:**

The bell will provide its damage bonus with concurrent abilities such as Beidou’s Tidecaller.

### Beidou's 'E' skill shield triggers The Bell's passive for 12% increased DMG every time irrespective of cooldown

**By:** ASHOKA\#5672  
**Added:** 11/19/2020

**Evidence:**  
[https://youtu.be/pqxLRoeWhyY](https://youtu.be/pqxLRoeWhyY)

Sequence of Clips and DMG numbers:

1. Rainslasher E hold without hit - 886
2. The Bell E hold without hit - 993
3. Rainslasher E hold with one hit - 902
4. The Bell E hold with one hit - 1010
5. Rainslasher E hold with electro aura - 1083
6. The Bell E hold with visible shield - 1010

**Significance:**

1. You get 12% extra DMG on every E hold strike on The Bell compared to Rainslasher.
2. Rainslasher can however give 8% more DMG than The Bell if the enemy has a Hydro/Electro aura.
3. The passive cooldown of The Bell does not matter for Beidou and her E hold shield can directly benefit from it.

### Beidou The Unforged Q snapshot interaction

**Theory/Finding/Bug:**

* Beidou's Q is snapshotted
* Beidou c1 gives a shield
* Unforged has an ATK% buff stacks that changes with a shield

**Finding:**  
Beidou's Q snapshot happens before gaining the bonus from Unforged's shield effect

**Evidence**:

* [snapshot base](https://imgur.com/q2nusx7)
* [shield snapshot difference](https://imgur.com/N4EN8xP)
