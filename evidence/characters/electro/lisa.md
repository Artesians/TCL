## Lisa C1 explanation
**Finding:** Lisa's C1 Miscommunication  
Lisa's C1 has a false and misleading description.
"Lisa recovers 2 Energy for every opponent hit while holding Violet Arc.
A maximum of 10 Energy can be regenerated in this manner at any one time."  

It also alters the Press E variant of Violet Arc as well as the Hold variant.  

When, in actuality, it could be better stated as:
"Lisa recovers 2 Energy for every opponent hit while pressing and connecting Violet Arc in its total Area of Effect.
She also recovers 2 Energy for every opponent hit connecting a held Violet Arc.
A maximum of 10 Energy can be regenerated in these manners at any one time."  

The energy gained is not affected by Lisa's ER and, as it implies, cannot be transferred to other units.
Theoretically, Lisa, with C1, can gain roughly 10 energy a second given the right situations.

**Evidence:**
- Energy is provided directly to Lisa in a delay after an enemy is hit with Violet Arc
- If Lisa is not present in the field before Energy is to be provided to Lisa, it will have no effect
- Energy gained through this is unaffected by ER%

Significance:
Clears up how Lisa's C1 actually works.
In knowing how C1 actually works, Lisa, when he is on-field, can effectively run much less ER on her gear and still recharge her Elemental Burst off CD given enough enemies/grouping.
C1 is a strong constellation for on-field Lisa.
