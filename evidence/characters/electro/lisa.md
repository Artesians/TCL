**Findings:**  
Just like Mona, Lisa can have two different normal animations depending on the distance from the target.

**Evidence:**  
[Youtube](https://youtu.be/swYPk57M3R8): First normal string has Lisa teleporting forward to the ruin guard, second normal string has her teleporting backward.

**Significance:**  
Combat positioning for Lisa

## Skill Mechanics

### Violet Arc's Press variant AoE is passed to all affected targets

By: ArchedNosi\#1484  
Added: 4/18/2021

**Findings:**

The description of Violet Arc clearly states that _opponents in a small AoE_ are additionally stacked with Conductive, and this is true. But it does not mention that enemies affected also will have their own radius, thus chaining more stacks of Conductive.  
Mobs hit via the initial small radius outputted by her Press E also output their own radius, and those in its radius can also get affectede by Conductive, including the initial target.

Can work in conjunction to the effect described in a below entry: **Violet Arc's Conductive status can be passed with Overload and Superconduct**

**Evidence:**

* [Showcase of the bounce being conducted once between 2 enemies](https://youtu.be/10QqWDgefpU)
* [Showcase of the bounce being conducted in a mass of enemies](https://youtu.be/t8SdGCkJ1lM)
  * One of the five Hilichurls only gained 1 Stack due to it aligning with only 1 radius, while the others had aligned in multiple radii, resulting in them gaining multiple stacks.

**Significance:**

Lisa can easily abuse this knowledge in tightly packed groups to quickly and efficiently stack her Conductive Stacks. This allows for smoother and more rapid gameplay. Also, with the inclusion of C1, Lisa can efficient recharge her Elemental Burst given a group of enemies whenever she is on-field.

### Violet Arc's Hold Variant has a Cylindrical Hitbox

**By:** ArchedNosi\#1484  
**Added**: 4/18/2021

**Findings:**

The hitbox of Lisa's Hold E is a cylinder with the following dimensions/attributes:

* Its Radius is indicated by its VFX and mobs' centers have to be inside said radius in order to take damage.
* Its Height/Depth is either unlimited or absurdly large. This is difficult to properly quantize.
* Its hitbox can clip through the terrain, allowing it to connect with enemies that are out of Lisa's direct Line of Sight.

**Evidence:**

* [Example of connecting Hold E against a mob that is clearly above Lisa](https://youtu.be/jkwgfrs-ahE)
* [Example of connecting Hold E against a mob that is clearly below Lisa](https://youtu.be/g_wgpsWe7mM)
* [Example of connecting Hold E against a mob that is clearly out of Lisa's direct Line of Sight](https://youtu.be/vnarA4Nmqns)

**Significance:**

No obvious and major significance in Spiral Abyss, but its extreme capabilities are nice to know and can potentially be of use in later content if verticality is ever a factor. Also debunks the common perception that Lisa's Hold E is a Sphere/Circle/Cylinder that has respect to only the visual radius.

### Violet Arc's Conductive status can be passed with Overload and Superconduct

**By:** ArchedNosi\#1484  
**Added:** 4/18/2021

**Findings:**

When Lisa's Press variant of Violet Arc strikes an opponent affected by Pyro or Cryo, the mob directly hit will immediately gain 2 Conductive Stacks, and others in the resulting Overload or Superconduct radius will gain 1 Conductive Stack, effectively radiating it.

If Violet Arc connects and causes Overload or Superconduct while in a Pyro or Cryo-environment \(the most common ones being Burning Grass and Frozen Water\), the direct mob will obtain 3 Conductive stacks and it will radiate 2 stacks to nearby opponents.

If 2 opponents are nearby and only one is afflicted with a status, Violet Arc, if it directly hits the afflicted mob, will add 3 stacks of Conductive to both enemies.

Can also work in conjunction with the effect described in a previous entry: [Violet Arc's Press variant AoE is passed to all affected targets](lisa.md#violet-arcs-press-variant-aoe-is-passed-to-all-affected-targets)

**Evidence:**

* [Press E on 2 Pyro-Inflicted Mobs](https://youtu.be/bLgOMM6GiP8)
  * Both at 3 stacks. The same outcome would apply if both are close by each other and only one of them is afflicted with Pyro/Cryo
* [Press E on 2 Cryo-Inflicted Mobs](https://youtu.be/bUrYn08k5jE)
  * Both at 3 stacks. The same outcome would apply if both are close by each other and only one of them is afflicted with Pyro/Cryo
* [Press E on 2 Distanced Mobs, one Pyro-inflicted and the other not](https://youtu.be/pI76J5xyl5k)
  * Only 2 stacks on the main target, and 1 stack on the other afflicted by Overload
* [Press E on 2 Distanced Mobs, one Cryo-inflicted and the other not](https://youtu.be/0axUu8fWiv0)
  * Only 2 stacks on the main target, and 1 stack on the other afflicted by Superconduct
* [Press E on a Pyro-inflicted mob in a Pyro-environment](https://imgur.com/gallery/3L3wYrt)
  * Target afflicted by 3 stacks. Had there been other nearby opponents, it would have been afflicted by 2 stacks
* [Press E on a Cryo-inflicted mob in a Cryo-environment](https://imgur.com/gallery/4ho7SB3) 
  * Target afflicted by 3 stacks. Had there been other nearby opponents, it would have been afflicted by 2 stacks

**Significance:**

Lisa can easily abuse this tech to quickly and efficiently stack Conductive. This allows for smoother and more rapid gameplay and very much opens up a Burst Carry archetype.

## Constellation Mechanics

### C1: Infinite Circuit

#### The Mechanics of Lisa's C1

**By:** ArchedNosi\#1484  
**Added:** 4/18/2021  
**Updated:** 9/10/2021

**Findings:**

The current description for Lisa's first constellation is currently limited, it states that:  
_"Lisa recovers 2 Energy for every opponent hit while holding Violet Arc. A maximum of 10 Energy can be regenerated in this manner at any one time"_  

Additionally, other mechanics with regards to the generated energy from this constellation are as follows:

* Energy is provided directly to Lisa in a delay after an opponent is hit with Violet Arc
* If Lisa is not present in the field before Energy is to be provided to Lisa, it will have no effect
* Energy gained this way is unaffected by Lisa's Energy Recharge stat

**Evidence:**

**UPDATE:** As of 2.1, [Lisa's C1 no longer works with her Tap E](https://youtu.be/HsD2_HZdVNU).  
While the videos below demonstrate C1's mechanics with Lisa's Tap E pre-2.1, Hold E functions the same way.

* [Example of Lisa gaining Energy in a delay](https://youtu.be/afcHsZ9wUM0)
  * Clip has Lisa at 78/80 Energy
* [Example of Energy not being provided to Lisa or her allies due to being swapped out before the delay](https://youtu.be/JTEGQ0Scz3k)
  * Clip has Lisa at 78/80 Energy

**Significance:**

In knowing how C1 actually works, Lisa, when she is on-field, can effectively run much less Energy Recharge on her artifacts and still recharge her Elemental Burst off cooldown given enough enemies and how they are grouped.

### C4: Plasma Eruption

#### C4 Description and Actual Effects are Miscommunicated

**By:** ArchedNosi\#1484  
**Added:** 11/10/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/906461937536217088/907909745048944700/transcript-lisa-c4-actual-effects-miscommunicated.html)  

**Finding:**  
The current description for Lisa's fourth constellation is currently falsely misleading, it states that it:  
* Increases the number of lightning bolts released by Lightning Rose by 1-3.
By this description, the assumed effect is that Arcs may release a potential of 2-4 Bolts/Discharges.  
However, Lisa's C4 affects Lightning Rose by making it release 1-3 Discharges, not add 1-3 Discharges.  

Additionally, the frequency at which how many Discharges are released per Arc also alters on enemy/entity count and has its own quirks:  
* If there is only 1 Enemy/Entity within the field, Lightning Rose will only release 1 Discharge with and without C4. (100% Rate)
* If there are 2 Enemies/Entities within the field, Lightning Rose will release 1 or 2 Discharges with C4.
  * Each Arc has a ~17.5% chance of releasing 1 Discharge and a ~82.5% chance of releasing 2 Discharges.
* If there are 3 or more Enemies/Entities within the field, Lightning Rose will release 1, 2, or 3 Discharges with C4.
  * Interestingly, this scenario carries two sets of randomizations:
    * One that randomizes between shooting 1 or 2 Discharges, following a 50% and 50% occurance rate, and the other randomizing between 1, 2, and 3 Discharges, following a 25%, 50%, and 25% occurance rate, respective to the number of Discharges.
    * The first Arc released from a Lightning Rose will never release 3 Discharges, rather it will either release 1 or 2 Discharges, with a 50:50 rate.
    * After the first Arc, following Arcs will follow either releasing 1 (25%), 2 (50%), or 3 Discharges (25%). 
    * However, if an Arc ever releases 3 Discharges, the subsequent Arc will release 1 or 2 Discharges, with the 50:50 ratio as described prior.
    * Overall, the average distribution between all occurances within 3 or 3+ Entities is around 30% of Arcs releasing 1 Discharge, 50% releasing 2 Discharges, and 20% releasing 3 Discharges.

**Evidence:**  
[Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k9m3ZWt0MdExphNuuc0OBTwSKwBXUDFGzxzljjyERGc/edit?usp=sharing) containing 241 total documented and recorded Trials between 1 Entity, 2 Entity, 3 Entity, and 3+ Entity situations.  
* [Video](https://youtu.be/QwSxT6SyCbM) of the 1 Entity Trial.  
* [Video A](https://youtu.be/GriXfqKfWLQ) and [Video B](https://youtu.be/WP02MEn8Qn4) of all 120 2 Entity Trials.  
* [Video](https://youtu.be/1liVFrHDfX8) of all 60 3 Entity Trials.  
* [Video](https://youtu.be/7WQgnKWCmj8) of all 60 3+ Entity Trials.  

120 Trials were done for 2 Entities as to provide a possibly more accurate ratio (17.5% for 1, and 82.5% for 2).  
Throughout all 3 and 3+ Entity Trials, all have showcased how the First Arc and Arcs following a 3 Discharge Arc occur in realeasing either 1 or 2 Discharges (50:50) and never in 3 Discharges.  

**Significance:**  
Clears up what the actual effects are of Lisa's C4 and the frequencies of each occurance within 1, 2, and 3+ entity scenarios. Also, if one is attempting to calculate how much C4 impacts Lightning Rose, on average and without taking account for possible AoE hits, in 1 Entity scenarios, there is no effect, in 2 Entity scenarios, it is around an 82.5% effectiveness increase, and in 3 or 3+ Entity scenarios, it is around a 90% effectiveness increase `(0.30*1 + 0.50*2 + 0.20*3)`.
