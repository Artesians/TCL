## Breaking Childe's Shield with Stagger

**Theory:** Childe's shield is broken through poise damage rather than raw damage.

**Evidence:** Childe has a separate poise value when shielded and unshielded. The hit that breaks his shield has no hitlag. The number of hits it takes to break his shield is unaffected by damage.
