**Finding:** Theory: Some bake-danukis that end up with investigation spot respawn. They seem to follow common enemies respawn pattern (12h), however it's still unclear.

**Evidence:**
* 2021-07-21 18:42:25 - <https://youtu.be/RWUUFzwP2f0> - first video
* 2021-07-23 11:38:29 - <https://youtu.be/QQDcTR_G04w> - second video (1 day 17h diff)
* 2021-07-24 05:52:53 - <https://youtu.be/1WHudr-4wZ8> - third video  (~19h diff)
* 2021-07-24 17:21:04 - <https://youtu.be/PghdzG1TlLc> - fourth video (~11h30min diff)

**Significance:** Some of them respawn artifacts so it might be a reliable way of getting more artifact fodder everyday.

## Wood Daily Drop Limit

**By:** Creonalia\#2818  
**Added:** 5/21/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842601710391787551/845506814519148574/transcript-2k-wood-daily-cap.html)

**Finding:** You can only collect 2,000 of any specific wood per day. This limit resets at server reset and cannot be reset by relogging/teleporting.

**Evidence:**

* Inventory before and after farming wood over 3 days: [https://imgur.com/a/tNZP68q](https://imgur.com/a/tNZP68q)
* Evidence that player cannot collect more bamboo, but can collect other wood: [https://youtu.be/f\_eQfp1FWLM](https://youtu.be/f_eQfp1FWLM) 
* Same for pine wood: [https://youtu.be/yh4PodfeX7c](https://youtu.be/yh4PodfeX7c)
* Hitting cap and testing teleport and logout/login \(and showing that neither reset the cap\): [https://youtu.be/pE-vHLpum6Q](https://youtu.be/pE-vHLpum6Q)
* Collecting pine wood after server reset \(marked by new daily commission quest at 0:12\): [https://youtu.be/9WrYqapBFkU](https://youtu.be/9WrYqapBFkU) 

Note that although I did need to teleport to get wood after reset, teleporting alone does not reset the cap, as shown above.

**Significance:** Useful for players to know if they're farming a massive amount of wood.

## Bush Droprates

**By:** gideleon1\#2188  
**Added:** 04/11/2021

**Finding:** There is an 8% chance to get something from a broken bush.

Out of 1,174 Bushes:

* 30 Lizards
* 32 Matsutakes
* 32 Eggs

It seems like the drop is chosen randomly. Testing was done during the day, because at night, fireflies are added to the pool. They do not replace anything in the loot table, because at night all four itesm were dropped. There has never been an instance of getting more than one drop out of a bush.

**Evidence:** [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mopokLcAiOwz9I7NS8LZnmNUhz57RStiXdyYN_yNc8/edit)

I didn't assume anyone would want a two hour video of me just breaking bushes, so I just compiled the results.

**Significance:** Was curious about the drop rates, and I couldn't find anything about them in the TCL, online, or in the data gathering server, so I figured I'd just do it myself. I wanted exact percentages just for the sake of thoroughness.

## Destroy Function Mechanics

**By:** xf3\#3123  
**Added:** 04/08/2021

**Finding:**

The destroy button in the inventory is the only way to mass delete/destroy items in the game other than the Parametric Transformer. However, the function itself is limited and the resources gained from destroying items are not worth compared to using them as fodder.

**Evidence:** [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/qRB1FWr)

By destroying artifacts, you either can get XP or Mora, it is the same for each. By destroying weapons, you obtain a number of 1\* enhancement ores based on the rarity of the weapon \(3 for 3 stars, 2 for 2 stars, 1 for 1 star\)

**Other Observations:**

* 5\* or 4\* artifacts and weapons cannot be destroyed
* Refined 3\* weapons cannot be destroyed
* Character development materials, Food \(except apples and sunsettias\), gadgets, quest, and precious items cannot be destroyed
* Material items that can be destroyed \(in addition to apples and sunsettia\) do not give anything when destroyed
* Some material items can be destroyed and some cannot. There does not seem to be consistent reasoning for why

**Significance:**

Destroying weapons is not efficient and causes you to lose weapon XP. Destroying artifacts although has no "real downside," the rewards given are lackluster and are better used as fodder. There is no reason to destroy items that give no rewards. Those items are better used for the Parametric Transformer if they need to be disposed of. The only upside is to mass clear inventory space, but due to the size of the inventory and the loss of XP, it does not warrant using the feature.

## Food Costs

**By:** Anmol43\#1917  
**Added:** 4/20/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833731587279028254/834272842425171978/transcript-all-food-cost-calcs.html)

**Finding:** Documenting the cost, in mora, of all food items in Genshin Impact.

**Evidence:** [Food Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vc7ioD_IH--9b7ZDbj4nPdByS6jTFyHx7jphxXNioz4/edit?usp=sharing)

**Methodology:** The cost of an ingredient is determined by the lowest cost of that ingredient in an NPC shop if the ingredient is sold. If the ingredient is not sold but is available on expeditions, then the ingredient is assigned a cost of 250, since a 20 hour expedition gives 5000 mora or an average of 20 ingredients \(average of 10 ingredients collected per expedition for each ingredient\), so the tradeoff for each ingredient is 250 Mora. If the ingredient is neither sold nor available on expeditions, the ingredient is assigned a cost of 0. Calculations are also made with reputation discount costs, which are gained for each region at Reputation Level 4. Character special foods are not considered.

**Notable Findings:**

* Cheapest 3\* instant heal \(assuming 20k HP\): Mondstadt Hashbrowns, 8.57 Health/Mora
* Most Mora-efficient heal \(assuming 20k HP\): Grilled Tiger Fish, 11.23 Health/Mora
* Cheapest Revive: Teyvat Fried Egg, 180 Mora if bought from restaurant
* Most Mora-efficient sprinting stamina reduction: Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup, 850 Mora

As other effects such as ATK buffs and Crit Rate buffs cannot be stacked, it is generally advised to use the best possible food in those categories rather than using the most mora-efficient food. However, the cost calculations are included in the spreadsheet.

**Significance:** players who frequently use food and are looking to save Mora can see which foods are cheapest/most Mora-efficient for their given effects.

## Paimon's Bargins

### Resin to Stardust Exchange Comparison

**By:** Mateng\#4507  
**Added:** 4/14/2021

**Findings**: Blue \(XP\) leylines are more stardust-efficient than Gold \(Mora\) leylines. They are 65.33 Stardust/Resin, while Gold leylines and Magic Crystal Ore conversion from the Blacksmiths are both 60 Stardust/Resin.

**Evidence:** [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/kx4jvr/exchange_rate_math_of_resin_to_stardust_math_post/)

I used simple exchange rate math to relate XP materials, Magic Crystal Ores, and Mora to their cost in Resin, and back to their cost in the Stardust Shop. I assumed that the chance of receiving 6 or 7 Adv. Exp and 4 or 5 Hero's Wits was 50%.

**Significance:** These findings identify that the most efficient use of Stardust \(outside of buying the 10 Fates, if the Traveler wishes to pay for them\) is to clear the limited amount of Mora, then the Magic Crystal Ores, then the Adventurer's Experience. Additionally, it is more Resin-efficient to be farming more Blue leylines than Gold ones.

## Crafting refund vs increase passives

**By:** jdeeyu\#9927

[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844202218369712199/845490580011352105/transcript-new-albedo-eula-crafting-passive-efficiency-vs-mona-xingqiu.html)

**Finding:** Albedo's crafting passive isn't just straight 20% better than Mona's crafting passive \(as stated in KQM guide\) due to the fact that Mona's passive also allows for more subsequent crafting to be done, therefore more trials, therefore more chances of success.

**Evidence:** Through simulating a large number of crafting trials, I will post a screenshot of my code below.  
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/Fqkpwc2)

**Significance:** Albedo/Eula passive isn't as good as it initially seems when compared to Xingqiu/Mona

**Conclusion:** From the results of my simulation \(feel free to scrutinize my code, I have double checked it 3-4x myself\), it seems that Eula/Albedo is passive is actually 10% better than than Xingqiu/Mona instead of the initial 20%. If you take into account the initial talent books for the comparison then the difference is a whopping 1%.

## Statue of Seven Healing

**Finding:** A Statue of Seven will heal \(and revive to full if dead\) without any restraint, provided that the character/party that you want to heal is not in the active \(on-field\) party.

**Evidence:** [Discord Video Link](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/847359141626118154/847360325702909962/video0.mov)

**Significance:** External source of infinite healing other than event domains \(until mHY patches the So7 again\).


## Overworld Farming Statistics

**By:** Bobrokrot#0111  
**Added** 07/11/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851577795868098600/864446326178447370/transcript-overworld-farming-statistics.html)

**Finding:**

***Artifact Drop Spots***  
There are two types of artifact spots:  
- "No mora" class - Spots from this class never drop Mora and always drop a single piece of artifact with 65% chance it being white artifact and 35% chance for green.
- "Has mora" class - Spots from this class always drop some amount of mora (200 on average), also the always drop white artifacts (1.5 on average) and never drop green artifacts.

***Ore Farming***  
- 1.2 ore per average seems consistent for all types of ores (excluding starsilver which there are currently not enough statistics). There are some fluctations due to low sample size for Iron and White Iron and due to the event of 3 chunks having very low probability. But overlall seems consistent. They sometimes drop two chunks, sometimes three and never one.
- Iron, White and Crystal chunk are all possible drops. 

**Evidence:** [Stats Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y4iE0NnktqMY-ahVIa6TDCl3bSepkQOfib4Ns_On-oM/edit#gid=0)

**Significance:** Statistics for farming purposes 

## Artifact EXP from Vendors Vs Domains

**By:** ceeeleste#3568  
**Added:** 6/28/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856083274458857493/858443928244322334/transcript-2-star-artifact-value.html)

**Finding:**  
Buying 2* artifacts from vendors is more worth than running a domain for artifact exp (Once a week)

**Evidence:**  
There are 3 artifact vendors, each selling five 2* artifacts for 2k mora each. Shop refreshes once a week. [Wiki Link.](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Shops#Artifacts)

Artifact vendors:  
Mora/Resin cost: 15 * 2k =  30k mora (10 resin)  
Total artifact exp: 15 * 840 = 12600 exp  
Resin worth: 12600/10 = 1260 exp/resin  

Domain Run (20 resin):  
Drop rates: [Wiki Link](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Loot_System/Artifact_Drop_Distribution)  
Average artifact exp: (1.068 * 3780) + (2.486 * 2520) + (3.546 * 1260) = 14769.72 exp  
Best case artifact exp: (2 * 3780) + (3 * 2520) + (4 * 1260) = 20160 exp  
2525 Mora: 2525/60000 = ~0.0421 resin   
Average resin worth: 14769.72/20.0421 = ~736.9 exp/resin  
Best case resin worth: 20160/20.0421 = ~1005.9 exp/resin

Vendor vs Domain:  
Average: 1260/736.9 = ~1.7099 (vendor 70.99% more worth)  
Best case: 1260/1005.9 = ~1.2526 (vendor 25.26% more worth)

**Significance:**  
Buying out the 3 artifact vendors once a week is more worth than running a domain for artifact exp.
Vendor is 70.99% more worth your resin on average, and 25.26% more worth for a best case domain run scenario.
  
## Vendor Artifacts vs Housing Sanctifying Essence  
  
**By:** K \឵឵#4000

  [Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/855808417447804938/858443909838929940/transcript-the-two-star-artifacts-you-buy-from-the-npc-shops-is-actually-still-worth-it.html)  
**Finding:**  
NPC artifact shops are a better deal than the sanctifying essence in terms of artifact experience.  
  
**Evidence:**  
12600=360  
10000=360  
For 360 realm currency you can get 10k artifact exp. However, the 2 star artifact experience you get from all three NPC shops is actually equals to more than 10k artifact EXP while costing the same amount of realm currency. The total mora cost for the npc shops is 30k mora for 15 2 star artifacts. 1 two star artifact gives 840 exp and they sell 5 which means 5x840=4200 and 4200x3(amount of NPC artifact shops)=12600.  

**Signifiance:**  
It's better to buy 3 10k mora with 360 realm currency than to buy 1 sanctifying essence for 360 realm currency because you get 2600 more artifact exp from the 30k mora when you buy artis from the npcs.  
360 Realm Currency can be converted to 10K artifact EXP.  
NPC shops sell 12.6K artifact XP worth of 2* artifacts for 30K Mora.  
The mora cost of buying out the NPC shop is equal to 360 realm currency.  

## Duplicate Special Dish

## Item Pickup Speed  

**By:** Chaos_Filler\#0746  
**Added:** 01/31/2021  

**Finding:**  
Picking up items from the bottom of the list is about 85% faster than from the top of the list.  

**Evidence:**  
Frame counting the YouTube: top-down took between 26±2 frames to collect the item while scrolling to the bottom of the list and picking up took 14±2 frames. Uncertainty could have been caused by inconsistent button-mashing. [Video](https://youtu.be/-dRnr-KFTbw)  

**Significance:**  
Spend less time on gathering loot and more time killing things.  

## Crabs Respawn  

**By:** Mcpie#8672

## Campfires act like 1U of Pyro Aura  

**By:** RazorClaws#4343  
**Added:** 07/15/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/864369706249355324/865083435184947200/transcript-campfires-act-like-1u-of-pyro-aura.html)

**Finding:**  
Lit campfires essentially have a 1U aura of pyro  that don't decay over time.

Consuming the campfire aura requires one of the following:
* One 1U application of Hydro or Electro
* Two 1U applications of Cryo, Anemo, or Geo
* One 2U (or higher) application of Cryo, Anemo, or Geo

The aura on the campfire is 1U, regardless of the Pyro aura applied.  
For example, Bennett's tap E, which applies 2U of Pyro, still creates a campfire that behaves the exact same as one lit with 1U of pyro.  

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
Putting out campfires with utmost efficiency

## Investigation Mechanics

### Daily Investigation Limit  

**By:** Mcpie#8672  
**Added:** 08/14/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/868135553764311051/876092967356629032/transcript-investigation-daily-limit.html)  

**Theory:**  
There exists an investigation daily limit of 100. It is possible to go beyond this number by not leaving the rendered zone after reaching 100. Bake-danukis that give investigation spots count towards this limit as well.

**Evidence:**  
Video shows me logging into genshin (Welkin, daily commissions displaying due to first login, 160 resin so I crafted condensated resin) and running through 100 investigation spots to showcase that if you investigate 100th spot then rerendering the zone WILL NOT display previously accessible investigation spots.  
[Video](https://youtu.be/vW7O4U4MoJQ)  
Above video contains timestamps of each spot and a counter on-screen. I also got artifacts from at least 4 bake-danukis that spawn artifact investiogation spot in the video and I increased the counter after each one of them.  

Video showcasing that it is possible to go beyond the cap. There's on-screen counter present showing how many investigation spots I have already gathered. I managed to get a total of 174 investigation spots.  
[Video](https://youtu.be/Uzs8yu6H1BI)

**Significance:**  
Since patch 2.0, if you're going to do artifact routes then you don't want to investigate every single spot there is due to this limit and the fact that there are over 100 investigation spots containing artifacts as of now.  
Additionally, because it's possible to go beyond 100 by not leaving the zone on 100th spot, it's advised to leave places with high amount of investigation spots for last.

### Daily Investigation Limit Reset

**Theory:**  
Daily investigation limit resets at daily reset.

**Evidence:**  
[Video](https://youtu.be/JWCW9NjTL8A)  
Video shows my character in 2 artifact spots that I have not picked on the previous day. Once I was in the Liyue cellar spot, daily reset happened - after teleporting far away and back, I was able to pick up investigation spots.  

**Significance:**  
Allows for early artifact route run if you still have uninvestigated spots.

### Daily Investigation Spots Post Daily Cap  

**By:** Mcpie#8672  
**Added:** 08/14/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/875747620621004800/876093025124761600/transcript-investigation-spots-post-daily-cap.html)  

**Theory:**  
We already know that the daily investigation cap is 100 and it's possible to go beyond that number by picking already rendered investigation spots.  
If you're about to hit the daily cap and go too far from the place you are at right now without teleporting/relogging and then go back, the rendered investigation spot is lost. This would mean that all investigation spots are stored in your memory and they are strictly connected to your render distance.  

**Evidence:**  
Timestamped: [Video](https://youtu.be/Uzs8yu6H1BI?t=1778) - gathered 99th spot, going north to get 100th which is the cap. There are 2 spots visible here to gather.  
Timestamped: [Video](https://youtu.be/Uzs8yu6H1BI?t=2780) - gathered 174 spots, no investigation spots present even though there was no teleport/relog happening.  
Area covered by black thick border shows the vicinity of where I was past 100th spot, while the dot displays timestamped above locations.

**Significance:**  
A test whether already rendered investigation spots get removed from your memory if you go too far or not - if it was allowed then it would be possible to walk through the entire inazuma (if you're some freaking absolute minmaxer), render all investigation spots at least once and then pick all of them up because everything is stored in your memory.

The above video displays that investigation spots are stored in your memory, and if you go too far then they are removed as it should be, because memory leaks are a horrible thing.

## Ice Bridge

### Ayaka infinite ice bridge

**Theory:**  
Ayaka can infinitely sprint across large bodies of water using her dash and infused basic attacks to freeze the water for herself. Anemo Resonance is recommended, I'm pretty sure, for adequate stamina regeneration; Ayaka has time for about four basic attacks before you should dash again to avoid falling into the water.

**Finding:**  
If you teleport before the mora going into the character's body, you will not gain any mora.  

**Evidence:**  
[Artifact spots example](https://youtu.be/dkvXti9LRns)  
[Elite example](https://youtu.be/XlanpPrNCNw)  

**Significance:**  
When you're speedrunning artifact route or elite route, you should wait for the mora to go into your character's body then teleport.
