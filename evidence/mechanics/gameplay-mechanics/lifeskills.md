## Destroy Function Mechanics

**Finding:**

The destroy button in the inventory is the only way to mass delete/destroy items in the game other than the Parametric Transformer. However, the function itself is limited and the resources gained from destroying items are not worth compared to using them as fodder.

**Evidence:** [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/qRB1FWr)

By destroying artifacts, you either can get XP or Mora, it is the same for each. By destroying weapons, you obtain a number of 1\* enhancement ores based on the rarity of the weapon \(3 for 3 stars, 2 for 2 stars, 1 for 1 star\)

**Other Observations:**

* 5\* or 4\* artifacts and weapons cannot be destroyed
* Refined 3\* weapons cannot be destroyed
* Character development materials, Food \(except apples and sunsettias\), gadgets, quest, and precious items cannot be destroyed
* Material items that can be destroyed \(in addition to apples and sunsettia\) do not give anything when destroyed
* Some material items can be destroyed and some cannot. There does not seem to be consistent reasoning for why

**Significance:**

Destroying weapons is not efficient and causes you to lose weapon XP. Destroying artifacts although has no "real downside," the rewards given are lackluster and are better used as fodder. There is no reason to destroy items that give no rewards. Those items are better used for the Parametric Transformer if they need to be disposed of. The only upside is to mass clear inventory space, but due to the size of the inventory and the loss of XP, it does not warrant using the feature.

## Bush droprates

Bushes have a 8% chance to drop loot at day they will drop a mix of lizards, eggs and matsutakes. At night fireflies are added into the loot table and you can use this together with the [Bushes respawn infinitely](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#infinite-bushes) to farm these materials.
