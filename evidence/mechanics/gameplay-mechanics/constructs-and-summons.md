# Constructs and Summons

## Constructs

### Construct Defensive Scaling

**By:** Greyhound\#7836 and Aevean Leeow\#1362  
**Added:** 4/11/2021

**Finding:** Confirming construct defensive stats\(HP/DEF/DR/RES\); All stats are taken at a 1:1 ratio \(except skills that state otherwise in description\) and snapshot on cast.

The constructs tested:

* Geo MC E
* Zhongli E
* Ningguang E
* Albedo E
* Ganyu E
* Amber E

Geo MC Q is unbreakable by anything in the game, it may be potentially coded at an unreachable value for enemy attacks\).

**Evidence:** [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n1ZqZ5FK62NQTc2ETqdojLCnPyoVVPyAxvOT4X-xZ2Q/edit#gid=0)

Video links and Geo MC/Zhongli/Albedo invisible number math fully compiled into the doc.

**Significance:** Better understanding of constructs and their scaling.

### Andruis can Destroy GMC's Q

**By:** Greyhound\#7836 and itsjaeYOU\#2868  
**Added:** 4/28/2021

**Finding:**  
While Geo MC's wall cannot be destroyed via damage sources, if the space where the wall is or will be deployed is occupied, the piece of the wall in that place (or any other construct's body) will be invalidated, and thus destroyed. Currently the only known enemy to have such an effect is Andrius' mid fight dash.

**Evidence:** [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yriAAQoYqRs) and [Video](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763610791839924224/836888357794742282/Genshin_Impact_2021.04.28_-_01.51.36.22.DVR.mp4)

**Significance:**  
Geo MC's wall is not as invincible as we once thought.
