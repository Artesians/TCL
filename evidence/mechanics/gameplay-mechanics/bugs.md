**Bug/Exploit:**
You're able to use your overworld team (regardless of character overlap with first half team) for the second half of Spiral Abyss by selecting retry at the same time as killing the last mob.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**
After you clear the second half it doesn't complete, I'm unsure whether it would be possible to trick it to complete somehow. It could be useful for speedrun showcases or character highlights in abyss.
