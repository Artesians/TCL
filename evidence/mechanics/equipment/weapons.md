# Weapons

## Bane of ... Series

### Lion's Roar Passive Applies to all forms of DMG inflicted on Electro-Debuffed Enemy

**By:** Doug\#8888

**Testing:** Keqing with no artifacts on and only a Lion's Roar. I autoattacked a hilichurl, cast stiletto for electro-debuff, then autoattacked again. Here are the 2 white\(physical\) numbers recorded.

* 400dmg - no debuff
* 469dmg - with electro aura

**Conclusion:** Lion's Roar passive applies to all forms of damage inflicted upon electro-debuffed monsters. This means that it is not only electro-based damage being increased, but also physical damage.

### Lion’s Roar Passive Works while the Holder is Off-Field

**By:** mikan\#2834 and IonFox\#8887

**Theory:** Lion's Roar passive is still in effect and will boost damage even when equipped character is off-screen

**Evidence**: [https://imgur.com/a/C3H8xEI%20](https://imgur.com/a/C3H8xEI%20)

* C2 XingQiu with Fillet blade and 631 total attack.
  * 1st wave: 161
  * 2nd wave: 183 with reduced Hydro Res
* Same XingQiu with base Lion's Roar and 635 total attack.
  * 1st wave: 186 damage on electro-afflicted enemy
  * 2nd wave: 211 damage on electro-afflicted enemy with reduced Hydro Res

**Significance:** Equipping support characters with Lion's Roar/Dragon's Bane/Rainslasher that deal damage even when off screen is a viable choice to increase damage output. For example, XingQiu in an electro \(Keqing\) or pyro \(Diluc\) focused team.

### Weapons with Bane Passive Applies to Amplifying Reactions, but not Transformative Ones

**By:** Lix-\#3417  
**Added:** 12/7/2020

**Theory/findings:** Can Lions Roar, 4TS,dragon's bane, ravens bow increase reaction dmg?

* The answer is no, for Transformative reactions
* But yes for Amplifying reactions \(melt and vaporize\)

**Evidence:**

Test 1: EC

* [Lion's Roar](http://imgur.com/a/Okini6O)
* [Favonius Sword](http://imgur.com/a/hZ65528)
* both shown 1022 dmg, lion's roar doesn't boost EC dmg

Test 2: Overload

* [Lion's Roar](http://imgur.com/a/5gfDQKS)
* [Favonius Sword](http://imgur.com/a/5gfDQKS)
* Both shown 1296 dmg, lions Roar doesn't boost overload dmg 

Test 3: Vaporize

* [Lion's Roar](http://imgur.com/a/5gfDQKS)
* [Favonius Sword](http://imgur.com/a/5gfDQKS)

**Significance:** Lions Roar and other weapons that have similiar passive don’t increase transformative reactions damage but do increase Damage for amplifying reactions.

## Blackcliff Series

### Blackcliff Sword Effect Persists Even if the Holder Switches Off-Field

**By:** Lix-\#3417  
**Added:** 12/7/2020

**Theory/Findings:**

* Does blackcliff bonus apply while the wielder is off field?
* And can you still get the buff if you kill the enemy with your skills while you're in the off field? 
* The answer is **yes**, it does apply to any char skills that remains in the field even if the character already switched

**Evidence:**

* [Test 1](http://imgur.com/a/BdeWL3u%20): XQ using blackcliff without inactive buff
* [Test 2](http://imgur.com/a/snOytCj%20): XQ using blackcliff with the active Buff
* [Test 3](http://imgur.com/a/o26Nngc) : XQ using blackcliff killing enemies while in off field, does he still get the buff? 
  * No, he does not

**Significance:** From the test we can conclude that the buff can be applied to their skills even if they are not in off field, **this also works on Fischl's Oz and Xiangling's Guoba.**

* For example, you can get a kill on Blackcliff Fischl, cast Oz, then swap off and Oz will still receive the Blackcliff buff

**The BC holder must be on field to activate the Blackcliff effect.**

## Favonius Series

### Favonius Weapons do not proc on Shielded Enemies

**By:** Sakuno\#7950  
**Added:** 2/4/2021

**Evidence:**

Testing was done using Diona @ around 40% crit rate spamming normal attacks with an R1 favonius warbow, and a Xingqiu @ around 40% crit rate using normal attacks with an R1 favonius sword. 3 minutes on average I attacked a hydro abyss mage and a shielded cyro slime, on both characters. All 4 tests resulted in 0 procs. When shields were broken, favonius proc'd as expected \(60% chance per crit\). Shielded fatui skirmishers on the other hand, does not prevent favonius from working since it does not block dmg completely like the others.

**Short demonstration**: *Streamable link lost to the sands of time*

**Significance**:

Favonius weapons suffer the same drawback as sacrificial and does not provide itself as an alternative weapon choice against shielded enemies. This leaves favonius where it was before, the inferior option against sacrificial unless you have no better.

### Favonius Weapons Procs On Multiple Enemies

**Finding:**  
Favonius weapons passive proc per enemy against multiple targets

**Evidence:**  
Tested with R2 Favonius Sword (70% proc chance) and 100% crit rate  
Using Xinyan E (duration 12s) to time passive cooldown  

Expected proc chance if the passive proc per enemy : 91%  
1 - 0.3^2 = 0.91

Result : 134 attempts, 123 proc, 11 non-proc  
91.8% proc chance

[Video 1](https://youtu.be/ZimedXXk07w) (21 attempts)  
[Video 2](https://youtu.be/zanvJ9V9K0U) (48 attempts)  
[Video 3](https://youtu.be/UyUWYnMFCCE) (65 attempts)


**Significance:**  
Favonius Weapons are more effective on character with large AOE abilities/against multiple targets 

## Millennial Movement Series

### Millennial Movement stack mechanics

**By:** rakka\#0099  
**Added:** 5/22/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844496410950631444/845499320081055744/transcript-millenial-movement-stack.html)

**Theory/Finding/Bug:** Millennial Effect Overlap Behavior

**Evidence:** Different weapons with the Millennial Movement effect can stack, however effects of the same buff-type will override each other. IE Elegy at R5 produces a 40% ATK bonus and a 200 EM bonus for the team however an R2 Song of Broken Pines produces a 25% ATK bonus and a 15% normal ATK speed bonus. If Elegy procs first and Pines second, the EM bonus from Elegy will stay applied however the 25% ATK bonus will override the 40% attack bonus and lower the overall effect of the shared buffs takes the most recent proc even if it takes the lower value.

* [No Buffs active](https://imgur.com/1clo8t2)
* [R5 Elegy active](https://imgur.com/ZeVAslN) \(40% ATK and 200EM bonus\)
* [R2 Broken Pines active on top of Elegy](https://imgur.com/XhmEod6) \(25% ATK from Pines overrides 40% from Elegy, however 200 EM from Elegy remains\)

**Significance:** Millennial Movement passives can stack, however if a buff type overlaps \(ATK, movement speed, EM, etc....\) then the last effects will override the previous effects while leaving the non-overlap effects alone.  
This means that mismatched refinements with overlapping effects can affect the complexity of when Millennial buffs need to proc, so either an Elegy and Pines on the same team should both be R1, R2, etc or it means that the player has to be aware of the order of operations for their swap comps.

## Royal Weapon Series

### The Effective Crit Rate of Royal Weapons

**By:** Cola\#6861

**Evidence:** [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v1hi6tUdFEC4SHM6_zwtlXOmCl_5paXqAD_d8uU6Umc/edit?usp=sharing)

* Ran simulations \(using google sheet's randomize function\) over 10,000 runs, each for 5%, 15% and 50% crit rate. 
* Recorded the average crit occurence for each set of 10,000 runs, for 10 times. 
* Averaged the results from 10 trials and came up with the average effective crit rate. 
* The same was done for refinement rank 1, 3 and 5. 

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/data.png)

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/result.png)

**Significance**

* Avoid crit rate circlet and minimize crit rate rolls on your substats. 
* The royal weapon line behaves, strangely, I know. 
* If you are SOL on artifacts however, the Royal weapons can make for a decent choice.

### How Royal LongSword’s Passive Works

**By:** Pleinair\#8321  
**Added:** 11/22/2020

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/YqjY3RN-QDs](https://youtu.be/YqjY3RN-QDs)

**Significance:** The sword is a rare case of actually working while off field. While Sacrificial sword is one of Xingqiu BiS this weapon would be more optimized for a dps build over the Harbinger of Dawn due to the overall higher raw stats it provides

**By:** IonFox\#8887

Further elaborating on @Pleinair's submission, Royal Longsword works exactly as written even when XQ is off field.

More evidence from Pleinair: [https://youtu.be/CEcNjSHqHTE ](https://youtu.be/CEcNjSHqHTE)

**Significance:**

As with above conclusion, there might be a use case where Royal Longsword offers a higher DPS ceiling than sacrificial or becomes a valid F2P alternative if players can mitigate the recharge loss through substats or a hydro DPS.

The video also reveals that there might be a tiny ICD or Royal Sword's ability, or that multiple hydro swords in a single wave count as 1 hit or a single source of damage, since only 1 stack of crit was granted. The second seems likely given how each wave only applies one instance of hydro now. However it has also been observed that swords can crit independently.

This also raises the question of other royal weapon use cases with off screen DPS, such as Royal Bow and Fischl's Oz.

**EDIT**: XQ's rain sword orbitals do not count as a hit when they apply hydro, not crit boost there.

### Royal Series Dynamic Stacking on Snapshot DoT Skills

**By:** sunnyd\#5916  
**Added:** 04/10/2021

**Finding:** Lisa's Q snapshots crit stacks from Royal Grimoire but the damage from the Q ticks will dynamically change the number of stacks

**Evidence:** [Youtube](https://youtu.be/rrrW7iYdU_I)

**Significance:** The passive of royal weapons continues to stack even when a snapshotting skill deals damage over time. First, cast the skill at low crit, and have the character gain crit from royal weapon's passive while the skill maintains its low crit rate because it snapshots. This allows stacks to be gained without an increased chance of losing them. Which means, the increased crit rate can then be capitalized on by casting high damage abilities during that window of increased crit rate.

### Royal Series AOE Abilities and Mechanics

**By:** Bobrokrot\#0111  
**Added:** 6/25/2021

[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856875279872032829/858177822186012722/transcript-royal-mechanics.html)

**Finding:** AoE abilities do "snapshot" crit rate.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/cUd-kFqAOSU](https://youtu.be/cUd-kFqAOSU) and [https://youtu.be/eJijOEJs4L0](https://youtu.be/eJijOEJs4L0) The tests were conducted as follows: gain 5 stacks of a Royal weapon, exit combat and then raise crit rate up to >100%. Then use an AoE ability and counter the number of non-crits.
If crit didn't "snapshot" and instead was calculated one by one, then after the first crit the crit rate would drop to ~60% due to losing 5 stacks of a R1 Royal weapon and the 2nd instanse of damage would have a reasonable chance to not crit.
In the above tests, not a single event of non-crit has been observed which allows us with a reasonable amount of confidence claim that AoE abilities do "snapshot" crit rate.

**Significance:** For Royal weapons it means that they can potentially have an increased efficiency given a right rotation. Although you can't gain multiple stacks with an AoE ability, what you can do is take advantage of the stacks you already gained through single target attacks. Damage dealt to all targets is guaranteed to have an increased constant crit rate, although it requires further analysis whether it actually yields better efficient crit rate or not for different rotations and combinations of base crit rate and Royal refinements.
One particular character that could take advantage of this that comes to mind is Yanfei since her typical attack pattern consists of 2-3 single target attacks followed by an AoE attack (which coincidentally cares about critting).

**Finding:** Mechanics of Royal weapon stacks:

After gaining a stack you cannot gain another one for a small period of time (cooldown).

For an AoE ability, damage instances dealt by the ability, including damage dealt by reactions Overload, Swirl and Superconduct caused by the ability, are put in a list. Then the game applies the following logic to all elements of the list one by one:

* if no_crit then
 * add crit_stack
 * add crit_stack_CD
* if no_crit and crit_stack_CD=true then
* do nothing
* else remove crit_stack

Stacks can be gained when the character equipped with the Royal weapon is off-field. 

**Evidence:** 
1) Sucrose's quick N1-N2 gaining 1 stack instead of 2 and multiple evidence of an AoE ability gaining no more than 1 stack when it non-crits multiple times. 
[https://youtu.be/PrXV4em0ssc](https://youtu.be/PrXV4em0ssc)  
2) After a single-target ability crits and causes a Swirl, the number of stacks is reset to 1 instead of 0 implying that damage from a Swirl is taken into account and is considered as non-crit. 
[https://youtu.be/mTEGm35iLmI](https://youtu.be/mTEGm35iLmI)  
3) Superconduct and Swirl chain reactions 
[https://youtu.be/hWfeeU6b9tM](https://youtu.be/hWfeeU6b9tM)  
4) Overload and Electro-charged 
[https://youtu.be/PrXV4em0ssc](https://youtu.be/PrXV4em0ssc)  

**Significance:** Royal weapons have an increased efficiency in situations when the holder triggers Overload, Swirl or Superconduct due to the fact that they can potentially always have at least 1 stack.

### Mathematical Analysis of Royal Weapon Effective Crit Rate

**By:** NZPIEFACE\#8439  
**Added:** 10/28/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/896590252930633728/903505119679750204/transcript-royal-weapons-have-extremely-diminishing-returns.html)  

**Finding:**  
A mathematical formula to find the effective crit rate of Royal weapons is not yet in the library, there is only a table and a simulation.

Use the following equation to analytically calculate for the final Crit Rate after using Royal Weapons:  
```
a = 1 - base_cr
b = 1 - base_cr - cr_from_royal
c = 1 - base_cr - cr_from_royal * 2
d = 1 - base_cr - cr_from_royal * 3
e = 1 - base_cr - cr_from_royal * 4
f = 1 - base_cr - cr_from_royal * 5
effective_cr = 1/(1 + a + a*b + a*b*c + a*b*c*d + a*b*c*d*e/(1-f))
```

**Evidence:**  
Math and explanation in here: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m1SLYcYBJVwCH_CpEgJgvnQOMB39iLAJZ9iNyT9EeLQ/)  
There is a python function in the doc to calculate effective crit rate from character crit rate and weapon refinement level. It's a useful tool if anyone ever wants to get this to work with fringe snapshot builds.

**Significance:**  
It was found that the crit rate that the weapons’ passive had decreased the higher the crit rate of the character was. The passive of the weapons performs poorly in comparison to other crit value stat sticks (Blackcliff series that is also from the shop, Harbinger of Dawn, etc.), and is only really comparable at extremely low values of investment into crit rate. While there is an argument that these would have value in the hands of new players who cannot invest into crit rate that much, it would also be a terrible long term investment for them as the weapon would naturally become worse and worse as they play.  

## Sacrificial Series

### Sacrificial Weapons do not proc on Shielded Enemies

**By:** Exuma\#1917  
**Added:** 2/4/2021

**Evidence:** Testing was done with Diona hold E with R1 sacrificial bow and XQ E with R1 sacrificial sword. Both units used 50 E skills on shielded pyro abyss mages and shielded geo slimes with 0 procs for both cases. When shields were broken, sac weapon procs were as expected. \(40% chance per hit on R1\)

**Short Demonstration:** *Streamable video lost to the sands of time*

**Significance:** This has many applications in combat, especially in abyss where timed trials will be affected by proc frequency and subsequently burst uptime. Sacrificial weapons are among the best support options so understanding their mechanics are necessary.

### Sacrificial Passive With Multiple E Stacks

**By:** mol\#3280  
**Added:** 5/6/2021  
[Disscussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837514129479827490/840052397882867752/transcript-sac-frags-reset-on-sucrose-c1.html)

**Finding:**  
When a character with multiple charges of their elemental skill procs the sacrificial passive, the elemental skill cooldown shown on the timer is the cooldown that will be reset.

**Evidence:**  
[I cast one Sucrose E](https://imgur.com/a/AKgnNoq), waited until the first cooldown was down to 5s, and cast the second E. A reset occurred, and the time of the second cooldown was ~15s \(minus 10% due to anemo resonance in video\). So, whatever timer is currently showing is the one which will be reset.

The same occurs for [Ganyu C2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837514129479827490/837875906907209728/2021-04-30_22-17-45_Trim.mp4) and [Klee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLdhyD7hBHo&start=133).

**Significance:**  
Any serial-cooldown, multi-cast skill user may waste sacrificial procs by causing a reset when their first cooldown is near 0s. Since the timer on stacked skills begins with the first skill cast out of the stack, and that skill is the one which is reset \(not the longer, still waiting cooldowns\), resets can be completely wasted on characters with multiple stacks. For example, with Sucrose it is possible to reset a skill with 0.1s of cooldown remaining, then have a stack of 15s go onto cooldown afterward. To get the most out of the cooldown benefit of sacrificial weapons, characters with multiple stacks might consider using stacks as quickly as possible.

**Finding:**  
4ESF DMG% bonus works with the ER% from Engulfing Lightning's effect but does not snapshot.  

**Evidence:**  
[Buff Evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esmABsiaOjY) Vye's stats, shown in video, are calculated for burst damage here assuming that the ER passive from Grasscutter does affect the 4-piece ESF set: (804+899) * (1+1.098) * (1+0.466+0.582) * (0.9) * ((100+70)/((100+70)+(100+85))) * 2.508 = 7909 Which about matches up with the damage number of 7906 in the video.  
[No snapshot evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asYD3tzpvC0) In the video, Engulfing Lightning is being used. The ending hits of Xiangling's burst are lower damage, indicating that the Burst DMG% from Engulfing Lightning's additional ER bonus on burst cast has worn off. 

**Significance:**  
Grasscutter + 4ESF have better synergy.

**Finding:**  
Kitain Spear energy drain do not happen immediately. There is about a 22-24 frame delay (can be longer depend on latency) from the moment your character elemental skill hit an enemy to when you character actually lose energy.

**Significance:**  
Some characters actually do not need to change their rotation, because as long as you can cast your burst within about 23 frames after the elemental skill hit an opponent, your character will still be able to use elemental burst to spend all your energy before getting drained by the weapon passive.  
Rosaria can hit enemy with her E to get her A1 crit rate buff and still be able to cast burst with Q afterward to share the crit before the energy is drained.

### Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds

#### Lost Prayer Stack Mechanics

**By:** Konbo\#0004  
**Added:** 12/7/2020

**Findings**:

* Lost Prayer does not reset upon leaving combat, ONLY upon switching to a different character or if the character falls.
* Stacks will also continue to build outside of combat as long as the character remains on the field.

**Evidence**:

Switched to a character with Lost Prayer, observed 0% DMG Bonus. Went into combat with a single left click, left combat, observed stacks continuing to build up, observed a 4 stack DMG bonus that remained indefinitely \(tested 5+ minutes afk\) until I switched off.

[https://youtu.be/W-ljqhTulD0 ](https://youtu.be/W-ljqhTulD0)

**Significance**: Lost Prayer becomes... even better for a main dps while exploring? The fact that you can carry over stacks over multiple fights will help in open world scenarios.

**Theory**: For Bolide or Memory of Dust purposes, Xingqiu Q/E are not shields. Beidou C1 and Diona E are.

**Evidence**: [https://youtu.be/Gpalhvn1f6Q ](https://youtu.be/Gpalhvn1f6Q%20)

**Significance**: Potential implication for unforged? And you can't get a free shield for memory of dust in your Klee/Xingqiu team.

### Mistsplitter Reforged  

#### Mistsplitter's stacks upon burst usage:  

**By:** gtrain#9987  
**Added:** 09/06/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/875440257619877908/884459387270332446/transcript-mistsplitter-burst-interactions.html)

**Finding:**  
Number of mistsplitter stacks gained on Q is character dependent, and for some characters is inconsistent. 

The usual number of stacks gained is as follows:  
0 stacks: AMC  
1 stack: Bennett, Electro MC (usually), Geo MC, Kaeya, Xingqiu (rain sword damage reduction)  
2 stacks: Ayaka, Jean, Kazuha, Keqing (initial hit, usually), Qiqi  

Non-snapshotted bursts like keqing are important to document, as we must know whether the stacks apply on the initial hit.

Inconsistencies are as follows:  
MC in general, but AMC in particular: does very weird things once swapping elements; it may be possible to manipulate this into getting an extra stack on Q, but requires more testing (see here: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/cvwreqXZvPs))  
Keqing: occasionally gains only 1 stack on the Q initial hit, even more rarely gains only 1 on the entire burst  
Xingqiu gets 1 stack on his DR swords. Casting Q resnaps dmg bonus on swords first made by E. Casting E during Q does not resnapshot dmg%. 

The ult stack seems to obey the same rules as the 4no effect, as the only character that usually only gains 0 mistsplitter stacks also generally does not obtain self-4no on their burst (AMC), though this is very inconsistent, and may also be manipulated by changing elements.

**Evidence:**  
[Speadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12wOAIniEr5D4MvmMU4MwxTm4LxaNUpFAAl6g1iAaLhY/edit#gid=0)

### Primordial Jade-Winged Spear

#### **PJWS On Hit Definition**

**By:** Vye\#9195  
**Added:** 04/15/2021

**Finding:** PJWS passive can be stacked from elemental skill and burst skill hits on an enemy. The "on hit" portion of the passive does not refer to normal attack hits alone.

**Evidence:** [Skill Stacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJZL7fOpCFo), [Burst Stacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Pq9CsDg_Q), [Off-field non-stacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuvFx74qMXk)

**Significance:** Triggering and maintaining PJWS stacks in real combat scenarios is a lot easier than initially assumed. Especially for certain units with a high hit rate elemental skill or burst skill like XL.

#### PJWS New Stacks Extend Duration

**Finding:**
New gained stacks on PJWS will extend the duration of existing stacks, beyond the 6 seconds stipulated.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:** XBDIT can stack PJWS for her second pyronado.

### Prototype Amber  

#### Prototype Amber Healing Clarification  

**By:** Reens#9389  
**Added:** 10/26/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/902702182086868993/902796682113204314/transcript-prototype-amber-healing-clarification.html)  

**Finding:**  
Prototype Amber's heal (4% rounded down) is based off the Max HP of the character being healed, not the max HP of the character equipped with the catalyst.  

**Evidence:**  
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/hof4TQg)  
Sucrose equipped with R1 Prototype Amber - max HP 15082 (4% rounded down is 603 hp):  
* Tartaglia Max HP 21466, Healed 858  
* Beidou Max HP 20162, Healed 806  
* Bennett Max HP 16163 Healed 646  

**Significance:**  
Stacking HP on a Prototype Amber wielder will not increase its healing.


### Prototype Starglitter

#### Prototype Starglitter Stacks Duration Refresh

**By:** elijam#7142  
**Added:** 07/29/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/869121335903813682/870107482016579624/transcript-starglitter-stack-refresh.html)

**Finding:**  
Gaining Prototype Starglitter stacks refreshes the duration of existing stacks

**Evidence:**  
CA damage on non crit before any skill uses is 181. First skill use at 30s, CA damage after first skill use with one stack on Prototype Starglitter is 196. Second skill use at 37s, CA damage after first skill use with two stacks is 210. CA damage is 210 again at 48s, after first stack would have expired if stacks were independent, and 181 again at 53s, after both stacks would have expired if gaining stacks refreshes the duration of existing stacks.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL06QKuVaUU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL06QKuVaUU)

**Significance:**  
Affects stack uptime considerations for polearm users with skill cooldowns less than 12s as it can potentially allow them to keep full uptime on two stacks of Prototype Starglitter's passive.

### Rust

#### Rust Damage Decrease

**By:** Amadurim\#8925  
**Added:** 04/05/2021

**Finding:** Rust DMG reduction on charge shots is additive and is in the same category as dmg% when calculated.

**Evidence:** Using level 50 Amber on Lv87 Hilichurl, with +20 physical goblet

* [Level 90 Prototype Crescent](https://imgur.com/nSaRkfP) \(No passive\)
* [Level 90 Rust](https://imgur.com/YsG8wlf)

**Calculations:**

```python
1062 = Amber total attack
1.583 = +20 physical dmg bonus cup
0.439 = Amber T1 aimed shot

===

1062 * 1.583 * 0.439 = 738.023
DEF + RES mod: (50+100)/((50+87)+200) * 0.9 = 0.400

Amber Damage w/Prototype Crescent = 738.023 * 0.400 = 295.209

===

Rust Passive:

If multiplicative: 295.209 * 0.9 = 265.688
If additive: 1062 * (1.583 - 0.1) * 0.439 * 0.400 = 276.560
```

Truncating decimals aside, the dmg number of "If additive" is the same as in-game numbers, hence the dmg reduction of Rust is additive and falls under dmg% in calculations. The same result is also seen in Slingshot.

**Significance:** The dmg reduction of Rust passive is pretty negligible.

### Serpent Spine

#### Rate of Loss of Serpent Spine Stacks

**By:** Reydriar\#8127  
**Added:** 12/7/2020

**Finding**: Losing Serpent Spine stacks has an ICD depending on the stack count.

* 5-4: 1.01-1.02s \(after you lost your 5th stack you can‘t lose the 4th stack for the named duration\)
* 4-3: 1.01-1.02s
* 3-2: 1.17-1.18s
* 2-1: 1.17-1.18s

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/qIDaHGeqfTY](https://youtu.be/qIDaHGeqfTY)

**Significance:** Getting hit by multi hit attacks will still only remove one stack thus increasing your overall uptime on stacks. 1 and 2 stacks have a better protection than higher stacks due to an increased ICD.

* Relevant examples in the overworld only: environmental damage
* Relevant examples: Ruin guard missiles or the cryo gun attack from the cryo fatui \([https://youtu.be/qaxgPjY78YE](https://youtu.be/qaxgPjY78YE)\)

#### Serpent Spine Damage Taken affects Shields

**Finding:** the damage taken increase from Serpent Spine's passive does affect the damage shields take.

**Evidence:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjYpIBPmNSQ

Explanation: The crystalize shield is created by a level 50 character with 0 EM, thus creating a ~786 health shield which has 2.5x effectiveness against its own element, meaning that it will block ~1965 pyro damage. Both flower stamens are dealing the same damage, and give the same results, with Beidou equipped with SS (with 5 stacks) taking 1045 damage per tick, and with fav sword taking 908 damage per tick. Beidou with SS 5 stack's shield lasted for 2 ticks allowed Beidou to take 123 damage additional damage, while the shield with favonius greatsword equipped lasted for 3 ticks and allowed Beidou to take 759 additional damage.

**Significance:** Explanation of how shields interaction with negative damage reduction

### Skyward Blade

#### Skyward Blade Description Clarification

**By:** Special\#1775  
**Added:** 12/6/2020

**Finding**:

* Skyward blade does not increase your damage after Elemental Burst but adds an additional line as bonus damage using the values on the description.
* Its separate line of damage crits individually from the normal attacks.

**Current Description:** "Increases the DMG of Normal and Charged Attack hits by 20% for 12s."

**More Accurate Description:** "Normal and Charged Attacks deal an additional 20% of Normal/Charged ATK as DMG for 12s" \(this additional damage is dealt separately\)

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/nn4\_xNJqsCA](https://youtu.be/nn4_xNJqsCA)

**Significance**

* Less synergy with electro builds since the bonus damage is a separate instance of white damage
* Synergises well with physical builds

### Skyward Pride

#### Skyward Pride Damage Interaction with 4 Set Gladiators

**By:** Chiefy\#2036  
**Added:** 3/30/2021

**Theory:** Skyward Pride's vacuum blades count as raw physical damage and not as normal or charged attacks for the purpose of 4 set Gladiators.

**Evidence**: Abyss 7-1 with 3 gladiator pieces vs 4 gladiator pieces

* 3 pc Glad: [2001 dmg](https://i.imgur.com/nsdFaA9.mp4)
* 4 pc Glad: [2026 dmg](https://i.imgur.com/ugbvgCB.mp4)

**Note:** The glad goblet had a bit of def, so the video of 4 pc Glad had a bit more atk than the bottom from Noelle C6 Q, resulting in 25 more vacuum blade damage.

**Finding:** Skyward Pride's vacuum blades can crit.

**Evidence:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7EN0Kl3l9A

**Finding:** Skyward Atlas' weapon proc can crit.

**Evidence:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcVPrTAAdu0&ab_channel=Arco

**Significance:** calculations should account for the crit possibility of weapon procs.

### The Bell

#### Bell’s %Increased Damage Passive Works With Any Shield

**By:** adri\#1824

**Finding:** The Bell's passive %Inc Damage works with any shield, and not just with the proc from the passive itself like the description suggests.

**Testing:** Attacked enemies

* without any shield 
* with the crystallize shield
* breastplate 
* and the shield from bell's passive

**Evidence:** [https://imgur.com/a/1fCJ6IM%20](https://imgur.com/a/1fCJ6IM%20)

**Significance:** Although there's better claymores, this makes The Bell significantly better than the passive description lets on. Makes for an ok Noelle weapon if prototypes are being used on another character.

### Luxurious Sea-Lord

#### Luxurious Sea-Lord interactions

**Finding:**  
Fishmore aka Luxurious Sea Lord has a passive that summons a titanic tuna to deal damage once every 15 seconds when the character's burst hits a target. Like other similar passives such as the ones in Prototype Archaic and Star Tombed Starsilver, it only procs when the wielder is on field.

**Significance:**  
The passive procs as intended similar to the other mentioned previously. However, ZyronX has confirmed that the passive has an aoe that can affect multiple targets with a single proc. It should be easier to do this if an anemo cc such as venti burst was used.

### The Flute

**Finding:** Taking damage while The Alley Flash's DMG% increase passive is disabled will reset the disable timer.

**Evidence:** https://youtu.be/9qbp8g0zJsY

Bennett takes hit 1 at 124 frames (2.083 seconds)
Bennett takes hit 2 at 261 frames (4.35 seconds)
The Alley Flash's passive symbol fully materializes at 561 frames (9.35 seconds)

**Significance:** Every time you take damage with Alley Flash equipped, you reset the timer and thus extend the downtime of the passive.

### Wolf's Gravestone

**Finding:**  
There is some inconsistency with shielded sword characters and aquila favonia procs.

**Evidence:**  
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/mEgcnveyTrg): Bennett with Diona's shield

[YouTube](https://youtu.be/ZSd-3ke6YmQ): Xingqiu with Diona's shield

The videos show:  
1/ How aquila does not proc when protected by a shield  
2/ How aquila can proc while in burst iframes, without a shield  
3/ How aquila can proc while in burst iframes, while protected by a shield

**Significance:**  
This interaction may affect other "triggers on taking dmg" + shield interactions. The only other ability I can think of that could be similarly affected would be Zhongli A2.

**Finding**: Certain weapon passives do not apply their effect on character stat pages for out-of-party characters. This only applies to weapons that either: 1) have a conditional stat buff or 2) provide one stat in relation to another. 

**Evidence**:
* [Deathmatch (conditional ATK%)](https://imgur.com/gOIr6g4)
* [Harbinger of Dawn (conditional crit rate)](https://imgur.com/CfL8jtd)
* [Lithic Series:  Spear & Blade (conditional ATK% and Crit %)](https://imgur.com/a/g7XHSXo)
* [Sword of Descension (conditional ATK)](https://imgur.com/0LnBMth)
* [Engulfing Lightning (ER to ATK %)](https://imgur.com/JReI6Ii)
* [Jade Cutter (HP to ATK)](https://imgur.com/Nf5F426)
* [Staff of Homa  (HP to ATK)](https://youtu.be/WhlTPu7A59o)

**Significance**: Characters using these weapons must be in your active party when their stats are viewed to get active numbers.

### Attack Speed Buffs on Claymores

**By:** EternalDream\#5503

**Added:** 2/4/2021

**Finding**: Attack Speed buffs do not dynamically affect Claymore Charged Attacks

**Evidence**: Side by side comparisons of a C0 vs C1 Xinyan

* [Triggered during spin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH6l4_oqJ7s)
* [Triggered before spin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln5VSljl3BY)

**Significance**: If an Attack Speed buff is active, such as Beidou's A4 after max parry, the charged attack will gain the speed increase for its entire length even if it wears off during the attack. Additionally, as the only character that can currently dynamically receive a speed buff mid-Charged Attack is Xinyan with C1, this means she MUST trigger the buff before-hand, as it will have no effect if triggered during the spin itself.

### Catalyst Effective Attack Comparisons

**By:** Maygi\#4987

**Findings**

Catalyst effective attack comparisons - see spreadsheet below.

**Evidence**

[https://imgur.com/a/TpQsJqS ](https://imgur.com/a/TpQsJqS%20)

**Methodology**

Effective attack was calculated with a simple piecewise function that takes into account crit rate, crit damage, attack, and damage % \(elemental damage\). Passives that cannot be quantified due to how they can differ in effectiveness with different playstyles are NOT included in the effective attack calculation.

The spreadsheet has three main columns - for low, medium, and high stats. Each one simulates the every possible substat combination with a total of 10, 20, or 30 offensive lines \(maximum possible rolls is 38, but nobody will ever get such lines - right?\). Royal weapon crit rate is simulated on each possible combination of stats. The base stats used were that of a level 90 Klee using 2 piece Gladiator and 2 piece Witch set.

**Significance**

Memory of dust can actually be strong, even without a shield doubling its effect. Widsith is around ~20% weaker than 5\* catalysts in general outside its burst window, and ~10% stronger during the burst window at R1 and ~30% stronger at R5.

### Refinement Costs

**Finding:** Refinement costs scales with the refinement rank of the current weapon

**Evidence:**

* [Refining a Rank 1 Weapon with a Rank 2 Weapon costs 1k mora](https://i.imgur.com/CuCPX85.jpeg) 
* [Refining a Rank 2 Weapon with a Rank 1 Weapon costs 2k mora](https://i.imgur.com/6ffhDkp.jpeg) 
* [Both result in Refinement Rank 3](https://youtu.be/hvGuXDmStKE)

**Significance:** If refining a weapon from R1 to R5, it's cheaper to constantly use the R1 weapon to refine. Also, if you're refining your levelled weapon multiple times, make the other refines first \(EX: For an R3 weapon, combine others to R2 before refining with the R3\)

### Weapon Stacks On Hit

**Finding:**  
Weapon passives with the description "on hit" or "scoring hits on opponents" can trigger on Normal Attack, Charged Attack, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst.

**Evidence:**  
* [Wolf's Gravestone - Rzctx#9737](https://youtu.be/1PBHhkYv3D8)  
* [Primordial Jade Winged-Spear](https://imgur.com/a/aq6Fg53)

* [Memory of Dust](https://youtu.be/DoDRg3OCY14)  
* [The Unforged - pai#3602](https://youtu.be/90FgVKrFyFI)  

The evidence for Summit Shaper is missing, but it should behave the same way as the other weapons in the same series.  

**Significance:**  
Documentation of how the ambiguous description of such weapon passives work.
