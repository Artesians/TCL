**Finding:**  
Geovishap Hatching shields don't activate the 4 Petra bonus

**Evidence:**  
[Video](https://youtu.be/Bc49zIE_30E)

**Significance:**  
Even though they're mechanically similar to crystallize shields, hatchling shields don't activate Petra, yet another reason the 4set is trash

## Blizzard Strayer

### Blizzard Strayer and Cryo Resonance don't Snapshot

**By:** Vye\#9195  
**Added:** 3/21/2021

**Findings**:

Cryo resonance and the artefact set Blizzard Strayer never snapshot even with abilities that snapshot. They are always dynamic and will change your crit rate in real time.

**Testing**:

Albedo E was used to perform the tests because it doesn't remove cryo on the enemy and it snapshots.

For cryo resonance, Albedo was equipped with artifacts to reach 85% crit rate without Blizzard Strayer set bonuses. Below is a video recording of using Albedo E followed by applying cryo to the enemy. Over a prolonged period I could not get a noncrit Albedo E proc against the enemy.

Following that I reduced the crit rate to 80% and equipped a complete Blizzard Strayer set to Albedo. Once again I could not get noncrit Albedo E proc against the enemy when using Albedo E first followed up by applying cryo to the enemy.

**Significance**:

You cannot snapshot Cryo Resonance or the Blizzard Strayer set bonuses for abilities that usually snapshot and last of a longer period of time.

## Bloodstained Chivalry

### **4pc Bloodstained Chivalry effect Does Not Work if a CO-OP Teammate takes the Kill**

**By:** Cenpi\#3224

No, it does not even if you have dealt &gt;80% dmg to the enemy.

[https://youtu.be/U2VhOcQTlw4](https://youtu.be/U2VhOcQTlw4)

### **4pc Bloodstained Chivalry effect Persists through a Character Swap**

**By:** Cenpi\#3224

Yes, it does[https://youtu.be/3y4R64qxzOs](https://youtu.be/3y4R64qxzOs)

### **4pc Bloodstained Chivalry effect doesn’t proc if an Off-Field character takes the Kill**

**By:** Cenpi\#3224

No, it does not.[https://youtu.be/zgyVLeUkFwU](https://youtu.be/zgyVLeUkFwU)

### **4pc Bloodstained Chivalry effect doesn’t proc if Holder gets a Kill while Off-Field**

**By:** Cenpi\#3224

No, it does not.[https://youtu.be/zaDYictHFTc](https://youtu.be/zaDYictHFTc)

### **4pc Bloodstained Chivalry effect can be Maintained by Chain Killing Enemies**

**By:** HailCorporate\#2970

**Finding:**

Bloodstained Chivalry 4 Piece Set Effect Can be maintained by chain killing enemies.

**Evidence:**

t=0, time of death of first Hilichurl

t=7, time of death of second Hilichurl

t=10, buff is still active

t=18, buff deactivates

[https://youtu.be/ufe9B4JR44w](https://youtu.be/ufe9B4JR44w)

**Additional Notes:**

* You still require the minimum amount of stamina to perform a Charged Attack, your stamina just won't be reduced on execution.
* Stamina regen will continue even while performing Charge Attacks provided the buff is active allowing you to save stamina for dashing.

## Crimson Witch of Flames

### Gaining stacks refreshes the duration of old stacks

**Finding:** Gaining a stack with the Crimson Witch set will refresh the duration of all previous stacks

**Evidence:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTyWdVPjgUU

**Significance:** Explanation of how Crimson Witch stacks work

### Crimson Witch Stacks remain after swapping characters

**By:** Greyhound\#7836  
**Added:** 6/26/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/855433084420489252/858194419470303252/transcript-library-completion-2.html)

**Finding:** Crimson Witch stacks remain after swapping characters.

**Evidence:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTyWdVPjgUU

**Significance:** Allows players to swap off crimson witch users while maintaining stacks

### **4pc Crimson Witch Effect Works Even When Holder is Off-Field**

**By:** Cenpi\#3224 and Boesik\#3192

The 4CW set adds 40% dmg to overload reactions. If the pyro holder drops a persistent skill which triggers a reaction while the pyro user is not on the field, will this 40% bonus apply?

* For example, if Keqing applies electro &gt; Xiangling drops Guoba a distance away from the enemy &gt; Swap back to Keqing and lure the enemy into Guoba fire, will this overload reaction benefit from the 40% set bonus?
* Yes, the overload reaction will benefit from the 40% bonus even though Xiangling is not on the field

**Video evidence**

* [https://youtu.be/PLlq0yDy5Bo](https://youtu.be/PLlq0yDy5Bo) - Overload dmg while CW holder inactive
* [https://youtu.be/Lwvv\_ZaV7fU](https://youtu.be/Lwvv_ZaV7fU) - Overload dmg while CW holder active
* Damage is the same

**Significance**

* Pyro supports can hold 4 set crimson witch and be quickly swapped in and out to drop their persistent pyro abilities without losing the bonus damage to overload.
* 4CW set effect applies even if the holder is not the active character. However, the holder must provide the triggering element.

## Maiden Beloved

### **4pc Maiden's Beloved Increases the Healing Effectiveness of Prototype Amber**

**By:** RoaringMeow\#2437

**- Is healing bonus applicable to the above mentioned weapon and increase its healing further?**

**Evidence:**

\(\#1\)[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/779076275699449856/780886363046150176/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/779076275699449856/780886363046150176/unknown.png)

\(\#2 Healing Bonus only:\) [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/779076275699449856/780889986219769876/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/779076275699449856/780889986219769876/unknown.png)

**Significance:**

* Yes it does, however the total healing output is nowhere close to 'actual healers' but for those curious here's the answer.  
* Healing Bonus does add on to the weapon as well the difference can be noted from no healing bonus and with healing bonus.  

**Without 4pc Maiden's = 2139**

**With healing bonus only = 2798**

**With 4pc Maiden's = 2888**

**Notes:**

Prototype Malice at R2

Healing bonus of 30.8%

Ningguang was used due to her low burst energy cost \(40\)

Above numbers have being subtracted from 150 \(started with that hp before healing\)

## Pale Flame

### 4pc Pale Flame Stacks persist after swap

**By:** Greyhound\#7836  
**Added:** 6/26/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/855433084420489252/858194419470303252/transcript-library-completion-2.html)

**Finding:** the stacks (and their related effects) generated by hitting enemies with elemental skill damage by the 4-piece Pale Flame artifact set persist after swapping characters.

**Evidence:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVE8RiCRls

**Significance:** allows 4-piece PF users to swap off

### 4pc Pale Flame Duration Refresh

**By:** Zozer#1782

**Added:** 6/22/2021

[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/854261942448554004/856798949322784788/transcript-4pc-pale-flame-duration-refresh.html)

**Finding:** Duration of 1st 4pc Pale Flame stack will reset upon receiving 2nd stack if the 1st stack hasn't expired yet.

**Evidence:** [Video](https://youtu.be/MeFPHEGQ554)

**Significance:** All character with elemental skill cooldown + animation time < 7s can maintain Pale Flame 2 stack buff indefinitely.

## Retracing Bolide

### 2-piece set bonus only works on user

**By:** Greyhound\#7836  
**Added:** 6/26/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/855433084420489252/858194419470303252/transcript-library-completion-2.html)

**Finding:** The 2-piece effect of the Retracing Bolide artifact set only works on the character equipping the artifact set; if the character using the set creates a shield and then swaps, the shield strength bonus will *not* persist.

**Evidence:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GccS6vz6U7g

**Significance:** using 2-piece bolide on shield supports for the shield strength bonus is pointless.

## Tenacity of the Millelith

### 4pc ToM procs against shielded enemies

**By:** Silvershine2\#5439  
**Added:** 5/22/2021

**Theory:** The 4 piece effect of Tenacity of the Millelith activates with elemental skills hitting shielded enemies and dealing no damage

**Evidence:**

* [VS elemental shields](https://youtu.be/w57ROmhHYnQ)  
* [Vs wood tower shields](https://youtu.be/Gfcc__WOHRw)  

**Significance:** 4pc Millelith can have 100% uptime even against enemies that block all incoming damage.

## Thundering Fury

### **How 4pc Thundering Fury Interacts with Elemental Mastery**

**By:** Saizaku\#5569

**4-set thundering fury gives +40% to damage caused by Overloaded, Electro-Charged, and Superconduct. We know that elemental mastery provides a multiplier to elemental reactions.**

**Question:** Is the 4 set thundering fury effect additive or multiplicative to the bonus from elemental mastery?

**Data:**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/data.png)

**Result:**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/result.png)

**Conclusion:** Damage boosts regarding reactions are additive with the multiplier from Elemental Mastery.

### **4pc Thundering Fury Effect Only Works if the Holder Procs the Reaction**

**By:** Cenpi\#3224

**The 4TF set effect adds 40% additional damage to electro-related reactions. In addition, everytime a reaction is proccd, the E CD is reduced by 1 second \(every 0.8s\).**

**The question is whether or not the holder must be the one proccing the reaction as opposed to a support.**

* For example, if Keqing has 4TF, applies electro, and Xiangling Guoba triggers overload, will this overload damage be increased by 40% or no?
* The answer is no. In order to benefit from the increased damage, Keqing must be the one triggering the reaction.
* This also applies for the cooldown reduction effect; Keqing must be the one triggering in order to get the cooldown reduction.

**Significance**

* In solo PvE play, Keqing does NOT frequently trigger elemental reactions due to her high rate of application of electro. 
* Therefore, Keqing does not significantly benefit from the 4 set thundering fury effect.

### **4pc Thundering Fury’s 40% ReactionDMG Increase Works When Wearer is Off-Field**

**By:** Boesik\#3192, Cenpi\#3224, Lix-\#3417

In short, yes. The 4 set TF increases reaction damage even if the holder is not on the field.

* **Note:** No significant EM differences. Level differences are: Xiangling lvl 60; Fischl lvl 70

**The following tests were conducted on a lvl 71 ruin guard:**

* Fischl proccing overload while present
  * Overload does 2066 damage
    * [Evidence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y0JE20gtA1KaUaRxjIBLMOXIpgPkt0hL/view?usp=sharing)
* Fischl proccing overload while not present
  * Overload does 2066 damage
    * See above video as well.
* Xiangling proccing overload
  * Overload does 1077 damage
    * [Evidence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ftweCspmafDCwRJE0CcKuopivYSaxZeK/view?usp=sharing)
* Fischl \(with no 4 set\) proccing overload both while present and not present
  * Overload does 1476 damage regardless of whether fischl is on field or not
    * [Evidence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/119FS4zyj0NYmpM9cHXguSrwGx6Zh6L-h/view?usp=sharing) \(for fischl on field\)
    * [Evidence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wr6goz63SzM4avsUuflDxP2HcGkggI5s/view?usp=sharing) \(for fischl not on field\)

**Significance**

* This finding means that you can put 4TF on a support and get the bonus damage to reactions even if they are not on the field.

### **4pc Thundering Fury Holder, if not on-field, cannot benefit from the CD Reduction**

**By:** Boesik\#3192, Cenpi\#3224, Wrathior\#4848, Lix-\#3417

In short, no. The 4TF holder must be on the field to gain the benefit of the 1s CD reduction.  
We know \(just to reaffirm\) that if the 4TF holder is on the field and proccing the reaction, the 1s CD reduction applies with every reaction

* [Xiangling using guoba on electro slimes shows each guoba tick reducing cd by 1 s.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B8s87WspSWaQshBOa6CiQrZeHowXInAf/view?usp=sharing)
* [Xingqiu using his swords to reduce cd by 1s on electro slimes.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wH2Ot4um675xcFqfjgzTsLAW1-jJ4aGa/view?usp=sharing)

But if the 4TF holder is not on the field but proccing the reaction, the 1s CD reduction [does not go through](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17yU8Lg6W7ZZcQO2V4C6P1VOaeTQPx-cA/view?usp=sharing).

* In the video you can see that at roughly 2.33s into the video guoba is summoned with 11.9s CD.
* 2 overloads occur \(at 4s and 6s\)
* At 8s into the video Xiangling is switched back in and guoba has a 6.2s CD
* In total, roughly 5.33s has passed and guoba has only gone down in 5.7s
* 2s has not been reduced and the 0.37s can be equated to just human error in measuring timings.

This result also confirmed by Lix-\#3417 using Barbara E and then switching to Keqing, no CD reduction occurred.

**Significance**

* 4TF holders who trigger reactions while not on the field will not get the 1s CDR.

### **Frame Analysis of 4pc Thundering Fury and Electro-charged Interactions**

**By:** Doug\#8888, ayynish\#5408

**Background**

4 set Thundering Fury has 2 effects

* +40% reaction damage to Superconduct, Overload, and Electro-charged
* Triggering such effects decreases Elemental Skill CD by 1s. Can only occur once every 0.8s.

**Theory**

* In Electrocharged, the E CDR \(cooldown reduction\) functions separately from the reaction damage bonus.
* In other words, it is possible to trigger the E CDR, without dealing reaction damage at the same instant.

**Evidence**

* Refer to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQI2LaQN4M) for analysis. Keqing is wearing 4TF and XQ is not.
* At 0:02, start counting frames.
  * Keqing is mid blink via E2 and is about to trigger an EC
  * Hydro aura will be applied by the XQ orbital swords and the E recast damage will trigger EC
  * Please observe the E cooldown. After E2, you will observe that frame in which it switches from E2 recast to the E cooldown, the cooldown shown is 6.8 seconds
* We will refer to the frame in which 6.8s CD becomes visible as frame 0
* Frame 0 
  * 6.8 E CD becomes visible
* Frame 3
  * Electro-charged font becomes visible
* Frame 4
  * 4TF effect is triggered
  * This is denoted by the white flash on the E circle and reduction of the cooldown to 5.8s
  * Observe the enemy and you can see a purple-white flash appear at the same time. 
* Frame 15
  * 1713 \(KQ EC dmg\) visible and HP reduction visible 
* Frame 67
  * KQ autoattack and purple-white flash appears
  * E CDR occurs and CD changes from 4.7s to 3.7s
* Frame 69
  * 1713 \(KQ EC dmg\) disappears 54 frames after becoming visible
* Frame 70
  * 777 \(XQ EC dmg\) visible and HP reduction visible
  * 55 frames after initial damage \(frame 15\)
* Frame 123
  * 777 \(XQ EC dmg\) disappears 53 frames after becoming visible
* Frame 129
  * 777 \(XQ EC dmg\) visible and HP reduction visible
  * 59 frames after previous tick \(frame 70\)
* Frames 4, 15, 57, and 69 demonstrate that in EC, the 4TF E CDR functions separately from the reaction damage
  * At frame 4, we obtained E CDR, but it wasn’t until frame 15 until the reaction damage actually went through.
  * At frame 57, we observe KQ trigger the 4TF E CDR, but there is no reaction damage
  * At frame 69, we realise that XQ triggered the next tick of EC because his orbital swords or Q swords were the last elemental source applied to the target.
* Thus, we can conclude that KQ can trigger 4TF’s E CDR effect without actually triggering EC reaction damage. 

**Significance**

* There are only 2 conditions for KQ to trigger E CDR in the context of EC.
  * 4TF must not be on CD \(0.8s ICD\)
  * KQ must apply an electro elemental source to an enemy with existing hydro aura.
* Therefore, 4TF is actually not hampered by EC’s 1 second ICD. As long as you can keep constant hydro aura on the enemy you can switch between different elemental sources \(E1, E2, electro-imbued autoattacks, and Q\) to obtain E CDR.

### 4TF Passive Triggered can be Triggered on Non-Damaging Elemental Applications

**By:** Sayline\#5959  
**Added:** 3/21/2021

**Finding**: Thundering Fury 4-piece set effect \(cooldown reduction\) can be triggered by non-damaging Hydro application.

**Evidence**:

I have 2 examples where this can be observed. The first one uses XQ's skill, where we see 4TF triggered repeatedly even without XQ doing any damaging moves \(Oz deals damage, but he is the aura, not trigger for EC\). [https://youtu.be/qSEwlawImHU](https://youtu.be/qSEwlawImHU)

The second example uses Barbara's skill. Here, Oz was the trigger majority of the time, but during his ICD, Barbara was able to trigger 4TF \(at about 00:07\). [https://youtu.be/nPvpICUd7qY](https://youtu.be/nPvpICUd7qY)

Here is a third example, where we don't rely on Oz as our electro crutch. Tested on Hidden Palace of Lianshan Formula I \(the weapon domain in Liyue\). [https://youtu.be/4FEWaKG7xJQ](https://youtu.be/4FEWaKG7xJQ)

**Significance**:

1. Limit testing for 4TF set effect.
2. Makes 4TF XQ carry an attractive idea to explore.

**Additionally**: No, 4TF does not reduce sac sword cooldown.

## Thundersoother

### **4pc Thundersoother's effect Works for Heroes Off-Field**

**By:** IlidanNaga\#2163

**Evidence:**

[https://youtu.be/4v-1j2LsxP4](https://youtu.be/4v-1j2LsxP4)

**Significance:**

It does work for heroes off screen, can be useful for pure electro dmg parties using Fischl as extra damage source

## **Tiara Sets**

### **Tiara Status Resist 1-set Effect Applies Even if not Visually Active**

**By:** tankex\#4275

In this test, we see if the 1 set effect of Tiara is active even when not visually active due to have 2 other concurrent set effects enabled \(eg 2 set Instructor + 2 set Berserker + 1 set Tiara\).

**Test:**

For the test I used Venti Lvl. 40 with and without Tiara of Flame \(40% less time affected by pyro\), and to apply the pyro debuff I used Xiangling's elemental skill with grass to create a fire surface.

Test 1 **-** No Tiara on, both set slots filled - Pyro debuff lasts for aprox 10 seconds

Test 2 **-** Tiara on, both set slots filled, tiara buff not showing - Pyro debuff lasts for aprox 4/5 seconds

Test 3 **-** Tiara on, buff showing - Pyro debuff lasts for approx 4/5 seconds

**Conclusion:**

The Tiara status resist 1-set effect applies even when not visually active.

### **80% Status Resistance is Possible through Tiara**

**By:** Tankex\#4275

In this test, we see if the 1 set effect of the Tiara is active in Domains and if its stackable with elemental resonances \(Hydro resonance for this particular test\).

**Tiara of Flame, Domain tests:**

Test 1 - No tiara, both set slots filled - Pyro debuff last long enough for the domain to reapply before it wears off. Pyro debuff infinite duration

Test 2 - Tiara on, both set slots filled, tiara buff not showing - Pyro debuff lasts 25 seconds

Test 3 - Tiara on, buff showing - Pyro debuff lasts 25 seconds

Test 4 - Tiara on, buff showing, hydro resonance up - Pyro debuff lasts for only 8 seconds.

**Conclusion:** the Tiara works with Leyline disorders and is additive with elemental resonances, so you are able to get up to 80% debuff resistance.

**Additional testing was performed by Tankex regarding electro debuff**

I decided to test if the "Affected by Element for 40% less time" bonus also work with other domains apart from fire. I did some runs with and without the tiara in "Hidden Palace of Lianshian Formula" to test the electro Debuff and I got this.

Test 1 - No tiara nor Elemental resonance - Duration of the Debuff 20 seconds.

Test 2 - Tiara on, no elemental resonance - Duration of the Debuff 12 seconds.

## Tiny Miracle

### **4pc Tiny Miracle Doesn't Proc on Damage Dealt to Shields**

**By:** Aevean Leeow\#1362

**Finding:** 4p Tiny Miracle doesn't proc on damage dealt to shields

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/q8dE3UzBHVA](https://youtu.be/q8dE3UzBHVA)  
Tiny Miracle is equipped and you don't get RES% buff until after shield is broken, shown in video

**Significance:** Very important for Tiny Miracle users. Min max your shield by getting hit before the shield is up.

## Viridescent Verener

### **4pc Viridescent Venerer Res Shred Mechanics**

**By:** SirBoi\#1101  
**Added:** 6/26/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/857278005424422952/858328123144798249/transcript-4vv-res-shred-mechanics.html)

**Findings:**  
Viridescent Venerer’s RES shred passive only buffs Swirl DMG against an enemy with a pre-existing aura.

**Evidence:**  
Tested against 3 Hilichurls of the same level, with Lisa first applying Electro aura on one Hilichurl and swirling with Venti


Things to know: Hilichurl base RES = 10%  
Hilichurl RES (with VV shred) = 10% - 40% = -30% (BUT res shred is halved below zero, so -30/2 = -15%)  
RES% Multiplier = 1 - Enemy RES%  
Incoming Swirl DMG = Outgoing Swirl DMG * RES% Multiplier  
Outgoing Swirl DMG = Incoming Swirl DMG / RES% Multiplier  

1st clip (Raven Bow Venti, 270 EM, 4VV): https://youtu.be/Ui78cv0ZyjM

Electro Swirl DMG on Swirled Hilichurl = 2603  
Outgoing DMG = 2603 / (1 - (-0.15)) = 2263.478261  
Calculated Swirl DMG against a Hilichurl with 10% RES: 2263 * (1 - 0.1) = 2036.7 (rounded to 2037)  
Swirl AoE DMG on surrounding Hilichurls = 2037  

Calculated Swirl DMG matches ingame Swirl DMG against a Hilichurl with base RES

2nd clip (Stringless Venti, 400 EM, 4VV): https://youtu.be/5Gvo_3Wzptc

Electro Swirl DMG on Swirled Hilichurl = 3173  
Outgoing DMG = 3173 / (1 - (-0.15)) = 2759.130435  
Calculated Swirl DMG against a Hilichurl with base RES:  
    2759 * (1 - 0.1) = 2483.217391 (rounded to 2483)  
Swirl AoE DMG on surrounding Hilichurls = 2483  

Again, calculated swirl DMG matches Swirl DMG ingame

3rd clip (Stringless Venti, 400 EM, 2NO + 2VV): https://youtu.be/QsQ90L5TUWc

Electro Swirl DMG on Swirled Hilichurl = 2134  
Swirl AoE DMG on surrounding Hilichurls = 2134

All Hilichurls had their base RES, therefore each of them received the same Swirl DMG.

**Findings:**  
Viridescent Venerer’s RES shred passive also works on surrounding enemies after being affected by Swirl’s AoE.

**Evidence:**  
Clip 1 was tested against the 3 same hilichurls using the same rotation and setup with Lisa + Venti (with ZL for shielding + res shred. https://youtu.be/bZOAH38YLMs

With Zhongli’s shred in effect, Lisa’s 1-hit AA dealt 16 Electro DMG against one Hilichurl. Since all Hilichurls share the same base RES, we can assume Lisa will deal 16 DMG to the other two when paired with Zhongli’s RES shred.

Venti triggered Swirl, and the Electro status as well as the DMG spread to the rest of the hilichurls (as for the different Swirl DMG values shown in the clip, reasons were Zhongli’s shield range + VV shred mechanic finding above).  After the Swirl, Lisa perfomed 1-hit AA on the Hilichurls, dealing 20 DMG to each one. ZL shred is still active in this scenario, but there is still a DMG increase after the VV proc from Venti.

Clip 2 involved the same enemies minus Zhongli shred. https://youtu.be/QzwUxjJ0k4U

Lisa’s 1-hit AA dealt 14 DMG and applied Electro to one Hilichurl. After swirling with Venti and triggering VV, Lisa performed 1-hit AA and dealt 18 DMG against each Hilichurl. Although the two Hilichurls weren’t affected by the Swirl reaction, they were affected by its AoE, and the VV resistance reduction was also applied afterward.

**Significance:**  
Viridescent Venerer continues to be a powerful set for Anemo supports. On 06/21/2021, the wiki stated that VV’s resistance reduction only affects the enemy hit by the Swirl reaction, but as I finished recording counterproof it had been changed, proving my findings.

### **4pc Viridescent Venerer can Simultaneously Stack Different Element Resist Debuffs**

**By:** Comfy Seaweed\#3841

**Theory:**

Viridescent Venerer 4set effect can trigger multiple times for different element, allowing you to stack different elemental resistances together.

**Testing:**

Used Barbara for hydro debuff, Fischl for electro debuff. Compared the dmg before and after swirl takes place

Barbara auto attack before swirl : 63

Barbara auto attack after swirl : 80

Fischl charged attack before swirl : 637

Fischl charged attack after swirl : 814

Proc hydro swirl, and then electro swirl. Check if both hydro resist debuff AND electro resist debuff exist simultaneously.

**Results:**

\_\*\*\_Theory was confirmed. See video for evidence.

**Theory:** Viridescent Venerer's 4-piece set effect can not only trigger multiple times for different elements, allowing you to stack debuffs, but it can also trigger two debuffs in a single anemo attack against Electro-Charged or Frozen targets.

**Evidence:**

[https://youtu.be/-6VU-qdN8Uw](https://youtu.be/-6VU-qdN8Uw)

In this video, Barbara's normals deal 34 damage when buffed by her C2 but not buffed by VV, and Beidou's burst deals 960 damage. After Jean attacks the target with a single use of Gale Blade, Barbara's normals deal 44 damage and Beidou's skill deals 1227 damage. Both Barbara's hydro attacks and Beidou's electro burst were buffed by a single anemo attack.

[https://youtu.be/bQmPheaLGXE](https://youtu.be/bQmPheaLGXE)

In this video, Jean does 98 Cryo damage \(infused by Chongyun\) on her normals with the VV buff, and Barbara does 41 damage with her normals with both VV and Xingqiu's C2 buff. When a frozen target is swirled, Jean does 98 damage and Barbara does 41 damage to the target, meaning that the target received both a Hydro resistance down and Cryo resistance down debuff from a single anemo attack.

**Signifiance:** Improves rotations; anemo characters don't need to be swapped in for each individual elemental debuff.

### **4pc Viridescent Venerer Explained**

**By:** dandandin\#1486

**Theory:**

I wanted to see how Viridescent Venerer would increase final Swirl damage. The important thing about 4p bonus is that Swirl damage will increase both from +60% Swirl % and also from -40% elemental resistance. Since it's damage depends on EM I made a graph for total increase as a function of EM \(attached here\).

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**

The 4p bonus increases a lot Swirl damage. Despite the low base damage of Swirl, this set will improve it in a way that sometimes it can be compared to 1 Electro-charged hit \(depending on char EM\).

**Finding:** 4 piece Viridescent Venerer \(vv\) only shreds if the wearer is onfield during a swirl that they trigger.

**Evidence:** \(Test 1\)Anemo wearers that trigger the swirl but whether the character is onfield or offield is variable : Tests showed that vv didnt shred when the character is offield when their Q triggers a swirl. It shredded when the character was onfield during a swirl.

Anemo and non-Anemo wearers that dont trigger the swirl but is onfield during a swirl:  
Tests showed 4p vv not shredding at all.

Non-Anemo wearers that are onfield and trigger the swirl:  
Tests showed that they can shred with 4p vv as long as they trigger the swirl with any element which is not geo/anemo \(which is only possible against enemies with an innate Anemo aura like the Anemo hypostasis\)

List of tests:

* Stat page for "Pyro as trigger element for swirl with 4p vv, WILL IT SHRED": [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXaYPqGqzOw&list=PLz6QN9PtrDi2ljLiXeHD3uNY6tLTaM4rB&index=12)
* With Pyro as Trigger for swirl, 4p vv procs the shred \(vs anemo hypo\): [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOjnH_y59dM&list=PLz6QN9PtrDi2ljLiXeHD3uNY6tLTaM4rB&index=13) 

**Conclusion:** 4p vv wearers can only shred if they fulfil the 2 requirements of being the trigger of the swirl and being onfield during the swirl. Other elements like pyro/cryo can also shred with 4p vv with the same 2 requirements.

**Significance:** Rotations to include 4p vv users is more strict and 4p vv can shred those with an innate Anemo aura with other elements as the trigger.

## **Artifact Substats Distribution**

**By:SafconGalore\#9752**

**TLDR; No, they seem to be skewed towards DEF in particular**

**Theory:**

Substats on artifacts are unevenly distributed

**Methodology**

Collected data on 157 artifacts, Flower and Feather only to be able to account for mainstat \(mainstats can't appear as substat\). Manually adjusted results for flat HP and ATK based on representation among the artifacts.

**Limitations**

n is of sufficient size. When foddering artifacts, they might not be chosen at random but may for some reason use def substats last. Ideally this would be further tested with a droprate table to be able to disregard the distortions from upgrading artifacts.

**Evidence:**

**See** [**picture**](https://imgur.com/a/E7m0epM)**.**

**Complete Dataset here:** [**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dLtUClmkfXLMaAylHhb\_B8LzZZXvxoRP\_1Md\_Fzt-8A/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dLtUClmkfXLMaAylHhb_B8LzZZXvxoRP_1Md_Fzt-8A/edit?usp=sharing)

**Result**

Substats are distributed evenly except for flat Def for some reason, which is significantly overrepresented.

## Uneven Substats Distribution

**Theory:** Substats for artifacts are unevenly distributed, with flat substats weighted higher than other substats, and crit substats weighted lower than other substats.

**Evidence:** TL;DR - We have the datamined substat probabilities from this link: [Dimbreath's datamine](https://github.com/Dimbreath/GenshinData/blob/main/Excel/ReliquaryAffixExcelConfigData.json)

Image summarizing this data is here: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/k2d3S3J)

The datamined figures are not exactly consistent with what we would expect from the actual data, but it is fairly close, and we might see better agreement with more data. See this [picture ](https://imgur.com/6VVaPt1)for the guesses that most closely aligns with the data. Flat substats definitely have a higher probability of being included than non-flat substats \(by maybe ~1.7x\), and crit is likely to be weighted lower.

I'm mostly submitting this since the entry in the current TCL \(under the Artifact Substat Distribution header\) uses a small sample size and the conclusions reached there are likely incorrect now that we have more/better data.

**Data:** I pulled artifact data from [/u/Acheron-X's table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQdCZN4lM23LNfSU36-zEKXC7sXBzeywSGhT1JW9SlqytYXHHFNVXos1yI0UPMqSyTU7KOe36mtjK9d/pubhtml#). The tables and charts in there shouldn't be used directly because it pools artifacts with different \#s of substats together, which leads to a slightly biased picture because you can't have repeating substats and they can't be the same as the main stat, so in artifacts with 3 substats for example, the "missing" fourth slot in the data is determined by which other substats \(and main stat\) have already shown up in that artifact.

**Methodology:** [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d9nC3x5Ho2lOfmUUMdgKq5h2cZ69VZ_m58OzKlh_muo/)

I pulled out data for 4 substat and 3 substat artifacts to analyze separately since those are the least biased, then ran a simulation after plugging in some guesses for the main stat and substat probabilities, and compared those simulated figures to the actual distributions. I settled on a rough proportion after getting something that seemed close enough to the sample.

More data would be needed to reach stronger conclusions. As of right now, there's only enough data to get a sense of the right substat probabilities, but the ones assumed below are highly subject to change.

**Significance:** The artifact grind is real and artifacts with good substats are rarer than you'd naively expect since you'll see ones with flat substats much more often.

## Breakpoints for 2 WT Set Bonus vs 4TF/CW Set Bonus

**Finding:**  
For transformative reactions, +80 EM is better than 4TF/CW bonus at <=490 EM without set bonus, while +160 EM is better than 4TF/CW bonus at <=1498 EM without set bonus

**Evidence:** 
- 4TF/CW provides a flat, additive bonus to the total % increase in the formula.
- The bonus provided 80/160 EM follows a hyperbolic decay as total EM increases.
- At 0 <= EM without set bonus <= 490 EM, 80 additional EM provides >=40% increase to the damage of a transformative reaction.
- At 0 <= EM without set bonus <= 1498 EM, 160 additional EM provides >=40% increase to the damage of a transformative reaction.  

Desmos sheet for visualization/calculations: [Desmos Link](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/7igtgtirot)

**Significance:**  
For characters building around triggering transformative reactions, if they do not utilize any other parts of the 4p set bonus provided by 4CW (vape/melt boost, pyro% increase) or 4TF (cool down reduction, elec% increase), then 2p Instructor and/or 2p WT may provide a larger boost to damage than the former two.
