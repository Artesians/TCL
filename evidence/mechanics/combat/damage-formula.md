**Finding:**  
Outcoming and incoming healing bonuses are additive.  

**Evidence:**  
[Video](https://youtu.be/yJMPaWKCCbA) Barbara with 9419 health, level 7 skill, 4pc maidens, and hydro resonance. Assuming outcome and income are additive, Barbara would heal for `((9419 * 0.06) + 664) * (1 + 0.15 + 0.20 + 0.30) = 2028.081` which video confirms.  

**Significance:**  
The two are additive.

[Expected vs actual damage from Barbara at various levels of def shred](https://i.imgur.com/SoXVYGs.png)  
In game damage of 1442 for Barbara and 3389 for Klee matches up with calculated damage at 90% def shred of 1443 for Barbara and 3391 for Klee, error within expected range due to stat page rounding. [Proof of Klee](https://i.imgur.com/hQiWOkq.mp4)

**Significance**  
Can't go past 100% damage increase.
