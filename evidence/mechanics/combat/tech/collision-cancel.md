**Finding:**  
Certain situations allow for characters to jump and land faster by colliding with something that stops them from moving upwards. Situations include overworld objects, certain enemies, and Geo MC and Zhongli constructs.

The number of frames saved depends on positioning, character, and move used, with Hu Tao CA in her infused state getting particularly fast cancels on certain enemies such as PMA.
Certainly possible for this to work on more enemies and objects. 

**Significance:**  
Possible to cancel moves faster than dash or jump cancel in certain scenarios and setups, for a potential dps increase.
