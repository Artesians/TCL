**Theory/Finding:**  
Aimed R-Cancel Charged Shot (ARCC) is an animation cancel technique that removes all ending animation frames after firing a charged shot with bow characters. It is performed by firing a shot on the same frame that you exit aim toggle mode.

To do ARCC: First, enter aim mode via aim toggle (R on PC, aim button on mobile, L2/LT/ZL on controller).
* PC and Mobile: Tap the Aim key (R) on the same frame you release Attack (M1).
* Controller: Release both the Aim button and the Attack button on the same frame.

ARCC is easier to do at 30 fps, as the frame lengths are longer.

ARCC shots have some quirks that are different from normal charged shots:
* When out of normal attack range from any targets, ARCC shots have a fixed height, regardless of how high or low the player aims.
* When within normal attack range of a target, ARCC shots will fire toward the target. (see arcc-autotarget )
* Non-C6 Ganyu, Yoimiya, and Aloy are unable to fire a fully-charged ARCC shot. They will always get a physical charged shot, regardless of charge level before release.
* C6 Ganyu can fire a fully-charged ARCC after using her skill.

Fluff: Some characters will stay winking after ARCC

**Significance:**  
ARCC is the fastest known method for shooting a charged shot. When done rapidly, it can be a significant DPS increase. However, ARCC is very difficult to perform, being off by even just a single frame will result in either no shot fired, or being stuck in aim mode for a long amount of time.

**Theory/Finding:**  
ARCC shots will autotarget objects when within range. This range is the same as the character's normal attack tracking range.

**Significance:**  
When within autoattacking range of an enemy, where you aim does not matter for ARCC. This is both good and bad. Good is that you don't have to aim in certain scenarios. Bad is that you are unable to headshot certain enemies with ARCC due to autotargeting.
