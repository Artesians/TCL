**Finding:**  
If you dash into enemy and jump at the same time, you can perform a plunging attack. This doesn't work against all enemies. Not all body types of player characters can do it.  

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
The only practical significance on this is yet another way to break Fatui Geo Chanter energy armour without claymore, Geo damage, or overload reactions;
since plunges do damage to it. Hard staggering an Abyss mage might be another use for this. This move also looks really cool to execute.

**Finding:**  
It is possible to jump in the window that occurs before a character switches. Depending on the ping, this window is large enough to gain enough height for the entering character to then jump again and plunge. Confirmed doable at 28ms to 130ms ping so far, but should be possible at higher pings too. Works on PC, console, and mobile.  

**Evidence:**  
There are two basic methods to performing a switch plunge:
1. Press switch, then jump as soon as possible, ideally 1ms later. Jump again immediately when the new character enters the field, and plunge.

2. Do an action that lets you buffer a switch. Examples include jump, dash, skill, plunge attack, and character switch cooldown. Buffering a switch means inputting the switch before the character finishes their action. The switch does not occur immediately, but instead happens sometime after the character finishes their action. It is possible to jump right before the switch occurs, gaining enough height for the entering character to jump again and plunge.

Keqing's hold skill allows her to teleport above the ground. If cast slightly above the ground, it is possible to switch characters in midair, allowing for the entering character to jump and plunge. [Imgur](https://imgur.com/fpnIttx)  

**Significance:**  
Although difficult and network dependent, it makes it possible to do flat ground plunges without needing to attack first, such as with dragonstrike, which can hinder reactions.
