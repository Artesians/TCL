## Electro Tanking

**Theory:** In patch 1.2, Razor and Beidou are the two of the best choices for tanking Electro DMG from an enemy of ANY level, without damage reduction like the reduction provided by Xingqiu's Elemental Skill, with unlimited resources. However, Hu Tao beats them both.

**Evidence:**

Razor has 80% Electro RES and was originally considered to be the best Electro Tank. However, enemy level infinity calcs for each enemy revealed that Beidou was superior at level infinity. The main reason is that there is no good transferrable shield for Electro dmg, as well as the fact that RES caps at 140%. The best Electro shield is Beidou counter, and the best transferrable Electro shield is C1 Beidou, which is around half the size of Beidou counter. 

Building Beidou as the tank/shielder in one allows for a much larger shield the more investments there are into HP, though she has less base DEF than razor. Thus, Beidou scales better with HP and Razor scales better with DEF. But due to the nature of the DEF formula, where the benefit of defense decreases with enemy level increases, HP outscales DEF, and thus Beidou should and does outscale Razor. 

In order to calculate questions like: When does Beidou outscale Razor? Has Razor been outscaled from the very beginning? and What are the best artifacts/compositions to tank Electro DMG? a program coded in Turing (available here: https://pastebin.com/9ZHEnyCU) was used.

**Results:**

For an arbitrary range of levels (1-100), assuming optimized builds without damage reduction (DR) against Electro damage in the overworld, Razor during his burst is tankier than Beidou holding counter. 

For this terribly impractical range of levels, 1 to 100, Razor's best weapon would be whiteblind, a c1 max HP build Beidou for his shield, and an A2 Zhongli to boost his shield%. He would take Thundersoother and Bolide, with 3 DEF% mainstats, 15 HP substats, and 10 DEF substats, prioritizing %HP/DEF substat choice over flat HP/DEF.

In a less optimized setting, Razor benefits more than Beidou as his strongest point is the Electro RES%, which does not need to be built for. Beidou needs HP% to scale both herself and her shield. Thus, even if you totally failed artifact grinding and got a terrible mainstats for Razor like Atk%/Phys%/CR%/CDMG%, with little HP or DEF substats and instead unluckily rolled into Crit Rate or Crit Damage -- *definitely a really bad build in general* -- Razor would still be tankier than Beidou. However, if the damage is spread out over time in smaller bursts, Beidou can mitigate the damage entirely with her counter more easily than Razor, though if Razor also has a shield he can do the same. If so, in this theoretical scenarios, healing from a support would be incredibly helpful. This is because in general, as long as your HP does not reach 0, regaining HP via healing will tend to make you live longer. 

If DR is not banned, Beidou also has a large amount of DR, which scales very well with other sources of DR. In this case, stacking DR via Beidou/Xingqiu/Jean with C6 will eclipse traditional methods of tanking damage, as damage reduction can be stacked to 100%.
 
Note that these conclusions are accurate only to 1.2. In 1.3, Zhongli's new shield will be stronger than Beidou's C1 shield for Electro damage. In fact, Razor's EHP at enemy level infinity will be greater than Beidou's EHP at enemy level infinity, or vs reaction type or monster skill effect damage. Thus, it is predicted that in 1.3, Razor will be the BiS tank at all enemy levels from 1 to infinity. These predictions are indeed true as of 1.3. Note that at some point in 1.3, the 140% RES cap was removed, and Razor becomes even better. 

Nevertheless, everyone in the game gets *absolutely smacked* by C6 Hu Tao's 200% Elemental Resistance, which makes all of this math pointless.

**Signifiance:** The electro slimes will overtake us soon, and it's necessary to know how best to defend against them.

## Climbing the Frostbearing Tree

**By:** Aevean Leeow\#1362  
**Added:** 03/23/2021

**Theory:** Without using any elemental skills/bursts, the glider, or characters/weapons not freely available to every account, is it possible to climb to the peak of the fully grown Frostbearing Tree? The answer is yes.

**Evidence:** Kaeya, a free character, is used. This is not to imply that other free characters cannot climb the tree, and it is highly likely that other characters can also perform this feat. This evidence merely demonstrates that climbing the tree under the previously mentioned limitations is indeed possible. No food buffs/resonances/etc are used.

Step 1. Climb the trunk by holding forward and spamming the jump button. This is precise and can take many attempts. [\(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRvU5e4B7GA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRvU5e4B7GA)

Step 1.5. Walk and jump up to scale the tree. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaGtJvQHBdQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaGtJvQHBdQ)

Step 2, Step 3. While scaling the tree, the first two obstacles can be "jumped around" from the left, as demonstrated. In fact, carefully walking around the branch is sufficient for step 2. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8yQ7-Hsv8o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8yQ7-Hsv8o)

Step 4. Jump to the area just below the peak of the tree. Both the butterfly and the branch can be landed on. This jump is also somewhat precise. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3L9tU8iDqs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3L9tU8iDqs)

Step 5. Jump to the peak of the tree from the butterfly. It is possible that normal attacking immediately after landing helps to stay on the branch. This step is very precise, and failing this step may lead to falling to ground level. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPmyIS7A3SY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPmyIS7A3SY)

**Significance:** By mastering these skills, you can climb the intimidating heights of the Frostbearing Tree with nothing but your bare hands. No Vision, elemental powers, or even a glider, are necessary. Indeed, rolling for anything is unnecessary, as the free characters provided to any player are adequate, meaning not even whales have an insurmountable advantage. Climbing to the peak of the tree has incredible significance due to the fact that the local surroundings of the Frostbearing Tree are of a generally lower height. Thus, climbing the Frostbearing tree allows you to get the height advantage, and doing so under these limitations means you can perform such strategic maneuvers under the most dire and desperate of situations.

Being at a greater height confers immense benefits. Those at a significant height over others possess a birds-eye view of the battlefield, allowing them to observe their enemies from afar. The great military strategist Sun Tzu once said, "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles." Furthermore, the advantage of height is not merely backed by military theory. In fact, it is has been a deciding factor throughout history. For example, Obi Wan cleverly defeated Anakin by utilising this intrinsic advantage unique to the high ground.

Also, you can perform a plunging attack off of the tree.

## Aether vs Lumine

**By:** Fluffy\#5580  
**Added:** 03/23/2021

**Theory:** The traveler twins are not equal.

**Evidence:** Using the OpenCV Python library, I have compared official images of both Aether and Lumine \(cropped to 400x700\). Reading these images as a 3d array \(Width x Height x RGB\) and comparing the sums of RGB for the total pixels, I have discovered that Lumine is more red, green, and blue than Aether. [Aether](https://imgur.com/a/Nm7xBRu) [Lumine](https://imgur.com/a/PKcOjzX) [Output](https://imgur.com/a/Y7bRGnd)

**Significance:** This means that Lumine is superior in all categories compared to Aether, so Lumine &gt; Aether. In addition, I have valid evidence to conclude another point. By squaring the resulting array and looking at the comparison once again, I found that Aether beats Lumine in blue now but still loses in red and green. Therefore, I believe I now have sufficient evidence to conclude that Lumine is Santa Claus, which makes her even cooler and just that much better than Aether.

## Electro Crystals have levels

**Finding:**  
Electro crystals have different damage values on the same world level, the recorded ones after defense are: 325, 267, 247, 279, 273, 297, 292, 303, 287, 283, the Lisa used for the test had 159 defense, meaning 15% damage reduction, further testing shows that there is no level differencial taken into the formula for crystal attacks, but they do have levels as indicated by reactions, the pre defense damage dealt by them is: 373, 307, 284, 320, 313, 341, 335, 348, 320, 325 repsectively to the values stated above, with the end results as:

| Electro Damage | Electro-Charged Damage | Calculated Crystal Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 325 | 1443 | 90 |
| 267 | 1135 | 80 |
| 247 | 1053 | 77 |
| 279 | 1189 | 82 |
| 273 | 1189 | 82 |
| 297 | 1307 | 86 |
| 292 | 1279 | 85 |
| 303 | 1337 | 87 |
| 287 | 1243 | 84 |
| 283 | 1216 | 83 |

The curious part is how 2 different crystal damages share the same level.

**Evidence:**

* [I went and got hit by every single electro crystal on the map with no stat change or effects to affect the damage taken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R738dkn2A4Q)  
* [the last 3 are in a different video that might as well be excluded as it provides nothing new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plkvuafVyKo)
* [Electro-charged testing result proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI7gNlhEmbg)
