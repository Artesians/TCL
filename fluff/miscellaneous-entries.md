## Climbing the Frostbearing Tree

**By:** Aevean Leeow\#1362  
**Added:** 03/23/2021

**Theory:** Without using any elemental skills/bursts, the glider, or characters/weapons not freely available to every account, is it possible to climb to the peak of the fully grown Frostbearing Tree? The answer is yes.

**Evidence:** Kaeya, a free character, is used. This is not to imply that other free characters cannot climb the tree, and it is highly likely that other characters can also perform this feat. This evidence merely demonstrates that climbing the tree under the previously mentioned limitations is indeed possible. No food buffs/resonances/etc are used.

Step 1. Climb the trunk by holding forward and spamming the jump button. This is precise and can take many attempts. [\(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRvU5e4B7GA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRvU5e4B7GA)

Step 1.5. Walk and jump up to scale the tree. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaGtJvQHBdQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaGtJvQHBdQ)

Step 2, Step 3. While scaling the tree, the first two obstacles can be "jumped around" from the left, as demonstrated. In fact, carefully walking around the branch is sufficient for step 2. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8yQ7-Hsv8o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8yQ7-Hsv8o)

Step 4. Jump to the area just below the peak of the tree. Both the butterfly and the branch can be landed on. This jump is also somewhat precise. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3L9tU8iDqs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3L9tU8iDqs)

Step 5. Jump to the peak of the tree from the butterfly. It is possible that normal attacking immediately after landing helps to stay on the branch. This step is very precise, and failing this step may lead to falling to ground level. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPmyIS7A3SY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPmyIS7A3SY)

**Significance:** By mastering these skills, you can climb the intimidating heights of the Frostbearing Tree with nothing but your bare hands. No Vision, elemental powers, or even a glider, are necessary. Indeed, rolling for anything is unnecessary, as the free characters provided to any player are adequate, meaning not even whales have an insurmountable advantage. Climbing to the peak of the tree has incredible significance due to the fact that the local surroundings of the Frostbearing Tree are of a generally lower height. Thus, climbing the Frostbearing tree allows you to get the height advantage, and doing so under these limitations means you can perform such strategic maneuvers under the most dire and desperate of situations.

Being at a greater height confers immense benefits. Those at a significant height over others possess a birds-eye view of the battlefield, allowing them to observe their enemies from afar. The great military strategist Sun Tzu once said, "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles." Furthermore, the advantage of height is not merely backed by military theory. In fact, it is has been a deciding factor throughout history. For example, Obi Wan cleverly defeated Anakin by utilising this intrinsic advantage unique to the high ground.

Also, you can perform a plunging attack off of the tree.

## Aether vs Lumine

**By:** Fluffy\#5580  
**Added:** 03/23/2021

**Theory:** The traveler twins are not equal.

**Evidence:** Using the OpenCV Python library, I have compared official images of both Aether and Lumine \(cropped to 400x700\). Reading these images as a 3d array \(Width x Height x RGB\) and comparing the sums of RGB for the total pixels, I have discovered that Lumine is more red, green, and blue than Aether. [Aether](https://imgur.com/a/Nm7xBRu) [Lumine](https://imgur.com/a/PKcOjzX) [Output](https://imgur.com/a/Y7bRGnd)

**Significance:** This means that Lumine is superior in all categories compared to Aether, so Lumine &gt; Aether. In addition, I have valid evidence to conclude another point. By squaring the resulting array and looking at the comparison once again, I found that Aether beats Lumine in blue now but still loses in red and green. Therefore, I believe I now have sufficient evidence to conclude that Lumine is Santa Claus, which makes her even cooler and just that much better than Aether.

## Electro Crystals have levels

[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/832412514858958878/835397401812533268/transcript-electro-crystals-have-levels.html)

**Finding:**  
Electro crystals have different damage values on the same world level, the recorded ones after defense are: 325, 267, 247, 279, 273, 297, 292, 303, 287, 283, the Lisa used for the test had 159 defense, meaning 15% damage reduction, further testing shows that there is no level differencial taken into the formula for crystal attacks, but they do have levels as indicated by reactions, the pre defense damage dealt by them is: 373, 307, 284, 320, 313, 341, 335, 348, 320, 325 repsectively to the values stated above, with the end results as:

| Electro Damage | Electro-Charged Damage | Calculated Crystal Level |
|---|---|---|
| 325 | 1443 | 90 |
| 267 | 1135 | 80 |
| 247 | 1053 | 77 |
| 279 | 1189 | 82 |
| 273 | 1189 | 82 |
| 297 | 1307 | 86 |
| 292 | 1279 | 85 |
| 303 | 1337 | 87 |
| 287 | 1243 | 84 |
| 283 | 1216 | 83 |

The curious part is how 2 different crystal damages share the same level.

**Evidence:**  
* [I went and got hit by every single electro crystal on the map with no stat change or effects to affect the damage taken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R738dkn2A4Q)  
* [the last 3 are in a different video that might as well be excluded as it provides nothing new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plkvuafVyKo)
* [Electro-charged testing result proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI7gNlhEmbg)

**Significance:**
