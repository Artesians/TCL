## Bush Droprates

**By:** [gideleon1\#2188](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/lifeskills.md#bush-droprates)  

Bushes have a 8% chance to drop loot, they will drop:

* Lizards
* Eggs
* Masutakes
* Fireflies \(nightime only\)

This information can be used together with the[ infinite spawning bushes bug](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#infinite-bushes) to farm these materials.

## Crafting refund vs increase passives

**By:** [jdeeyu\#9927](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/lifeskills.md#crafting-refund-vs-increase-passives)

Eula and albedo's passive has a 10% chance to give more materials while Xingqiu and Mona has a 25% chance to refund a part of the materials used. By simulating a very large number of crafts we found that Eula/Albedo's passive is actually 10% better than than Xingqiu/Mona. If you take into account the initial talent books for the comparison then the difference is a whopping 1%.

## Destroy Mechanics

**By:** [xf3\#3123](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/lifeskills.md#destroy-function-mechanics)

The destroy function in your inventory is the only way to mass delete/destroy items in the game other than the Parametric Transformer. However, the function itself is limited and the resources gained from destroying items are not worth compared to using them as fodder.

Destroying Artifacts will give mora equal to the amount of artifact XP. While destroying weapons, will give a number of 1 star enhancement ores based on the rarity of the weapon \(3 for 3 stars, 2 for 2 stars, 1 for 1 star\).

#### Destroying +0 Artifacts:

| Rarity | Artifact XP | Mora from Destroying |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 4 Star | 2520 | 2520 |
| 3 Star | 1260 | 1260 |
| 2 Star | 840 | 840 |
| 1 Star | 420 | 420 |

#### Destroying Level 1 Weapons:

| Rarity | Weapon XP | Crystal XP from Destroying |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3 Star | 1800 | 1200 |
| 2 Star | 1200 | 800 |
| 1 Star | 600 | 400 |

#### Can't be Destroyed:

* 5\* artifacts
* 5\* or 4\* Weapons
* Refined 3\* weapons
* Character Development Materials
* Food \(except apples and sunsettia\)
* Gadgets 
* Quest Items
* Precious Items

Certain material items can be destroyed, but they don't give anything when destroyed, the same goes for apples and sunsettias too. However, not all material items can be destroyed, as of now, there is no consistent reason as to why.

## Food Costs

**By:** [Anmol43\#1917](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/lifeskills.md#food-costs)

* Cheapest 3\* instant heal \(assuming 20k HP\): Mondstadt Hashbrowns, 8.57 Health/Mora
* Most Mora-efficient heal \(assuming 20k HP\): Grilled Tiger Fish, 11.23 Health/Mora
* Cheapest Revive: Teyvat Fried Egg, 180 Mora if bought from restaurant
* Most Mora-efficient sprinting stamina reduction: Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup, 850 Mora

As other effects such as ATK buffs and Crit Rate buffs cannot be stacked, it is generally advised to use the best possible food in those categories rather than using the most mora-efficient food. However, the cost calculations are included in the spreadsheet.

## Paimon's Bargins

### Resin to Stardust Exchange Comparison

**By:** [Mateng\#4507](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/lifeskills.md#resin-to-stardust-exchange-comparison)

Blue \(XP\) leylines are more stardust-efficient than Gold \(Mora\) leylines.

* Exp Leyline: 65.33 Stardust/Resin
* Mora Leyline: 60 Stardust/Resin
* Magic Crystal Ore: 60 Stardust/Resin

## Wood Daily Drop Limit

**By:** [Creonalia\#2818 ](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/lifeskills.md#wood-daily-drop-limit)

You can only collect 2,000 of any specific wood per day. This limit resets at server reset and cannot be reset by relogging/teleporting.

## Statue of the Seven Healing

**By:** [Asaki\#9139](https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/lifeskills#statue-of-seven-healing)

If you place a character in a party that is not at full HP or fainted and swap to a different party, you can heal and revive them without consuming Statue of the Seven HP.


## Overworld Farming Statistics

### Artifact Drop Spots

There are two types of artifact spots:  
- "No mora" class - Spots from this class never drop Mora and always drop a single piece of artifact with 65% chance it being white artifact and 35% chance for green.
- "Has mora" class - Spots from this class always drop some amount of mora (200 on average), also the always drop white artifacts (1.5 on average) and never drop green artifacts.

### Ore Farming

- 1.2 ore per average seems consistent for all types of ores (excluding starsilver which there are currently not enough statistics). There are some fluctations due to low sample size for Iron and White Iron and due to the event of 3 chunks having very low probability. But overlall seems consistent. They sometimes drop two chunks, sometimes three and never one.
- Iron, White and Crystal chunk are all possible drops. 

*Check the Evidence Vault for more statistics data*

## Artifact EXP Efficiency

* 2-star artifact vendors are, on average, 70.99% more EXP per resin than farming artifact domains for artifact EXP.  
* NPC shops sell 12.6K artifact XP worth of 2* artifacts for 30K Mora.  
* The mora cost of buying out the NPC shops is equal to 360 realm currency.  
* NPC shop artifacts are more worth to buy than sanctifying essence.  

## Special Dish Duplication  

Character with extra dish passive can duplicate their specialties while cooking.  
**By:** [denmax\#9293](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/lifeskills.md#duplicate-special-dish)  

## Item Pickup Speed  
Picking up items from the bottom of the list is about 85% faster than from the top of the list.  


## Crabs Respawn  

**By:** [Mcpie#8672](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/lifeskills.md#crabs-respawn)

Crabs that you approach and fail to pick up will respawn after leaving their render distances and coming back.

## Campfires

Lit campfires essentially have a 1U aura of pyro  that don't decay over time.

Consuming the campfire aura requires one of the following:
* One 1U application of Hydro or Electro
* Two 1U applications of Cryo, Anemo, or Geo
* One 2U (or higher) application of Cryo, Anemo, or Geo

The aura on the campfire is 1U, regardless of the Pyro aura applied.  
For example: Bennett's tap E, which applies 2U of Pyro, still creates a campfire that behaves the exact same as one lit with 1U of pyro.

## Investigation Mechanics  

### Daily Investigation Limit  

* There exists an investigation daily limit of 100. After that, you cannot "investigate" to pick up items anymore. This limit resets at daily reset.
  * It is possible to go beyond this number by not leaving the rendered zone after picking up the 100th investigation spot.

## Ice Bridge

* You can cross the water by applying cryo on water surface.
  * Ayaka can infinitely sprint across large bodies of water using her Dash and infused Normal Attacks to freeze the water for herself. She has time for about four basic attacks before you should dash again to avoid falling into the water.

## Wait for mora before teleporting

In overworld, you need to wait for flying mora to be absorbed by your character's body, if teleporting before it, the mora in mid-air will be lost forever.
