# Constructs and Summons

Certain skills create objects that stay on the field we call these constructs. 

GEO constructs are created by GEO characters and can usually but not always be climbed. There is a maximum limit of three constructs in one instance and you you create a fourth one the first construct placed will destroyed.
There is one exception to this which is the walls created by the Traveller's (Geo) Wake of Earth these walls also do not count towards the construct limit but are still considered Geo constructs. They do not take any damage and cannot be destroyed, only prevented from being created by other obstacles (including Geo constructs). 

Constructs take damage when hit by enemies just like characters and unless it is specified in the skill description the defensive stats will match the character using the skill at a 1:1 ratio. There are also some that are considered invunerable.
Light constructs can be affected by vaccums? such as Jean's elemental skill as sucrose elemental burst.

All temporary buffs are snapshotted at the moment of casting and will affect the construct for the entire duration
