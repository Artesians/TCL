## System bugs

Energy Particles don't stop moving even when you open a pause menu. You can absorb particles while in a pause menu. 
Works in every menu most notably adventure book and wish menu allowing it to be used in abyss (paimonbukeyi/#4732).

## Openworld

Bushes destroyed with Hu Tao's infused normal attacks will respawn allowing you to farm eggs.

## Abyss

You can use your overworld team in the second half of abyss even if the same members are in the first half of the chamber by [selecting retry at the same time as you kill the last enemy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW_TDsyFkPA)
