## Abyss

You can use your overworld team in the second half of abyss even if the same members are in the first half of the chamber by [selecting retry at the same time as you kill the last enemy.](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#using-the-same-team-for-both-abyss-halves)

When using the retry button in abyss your [elemental skill and burst will not reset its cooldown](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#elemental-skills-and-bursts-dont-reset-when-using-retry-in-abyss) so if you are too fast at starting the new encounter you will not be able to execute your opening moves properly.

## Overworld

[Bushes respawn infinitely](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#infinite-bushes) when Hu Tao infused with pyro sets them on fire.

## Lag

[There are a lot of strange interactions with lag.](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#lag-interactions) With unstable internet connection. Character stats are snapshotted client-side with enemy stats calculated server-side. This can lead to things like Bennett's burst healing past 70%, or Albedo's A1 not benefitting from enemies falling below 50% HP.

## Artifacts

The 4pc 4NO Bonus will not apply to Beidou, Ningguang, and Ganyu's burst as a result of their casting

## Miscellaneous

[Energy Particles don't stop moving even when you open a pause menu](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#particles-move-while-game-is-paused), you can also absorb them while paused too. This works in every menu, most notably adventure book and wish menu, allowing it to be used in abyss.

[Xiangling's Burst can stack](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#xianglings-burst-can-stack-in-contending-tides-event) in the Contending Tides event or when using a portable teleporter. This bug increases the duration of Xiangling's Pyronado and similar orbital bursts.

Venti's burst will deal its full elemental absorption damage [even if it is infused later in the burst](../../evidence/mechanics/gameplay-mechanics/bugs.md#venti-q-late-absorption-bug). This allows for extra damage for any enemies remaining in the zone.

## Fixed Bugs

### Turbo

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Overview" %}
When Oz triggers Overload or Superconduct with his **Normal Attack**, he generates a particle for each enemy hit by the reaction. This is called "**turbo**" energy generation. By using this mechanic in clumps of enemies, you can gain far more particles per Oz summon than you would normally be able to. Turbo team compositions are built to force this interaction often to fuel expensive elemental bursts. This in turn reduces the energy recharge investment for units, which allows for more investment into damage.

| Number of Enemies | C0-C5 Particles | C6 Particles |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 40.8 | 50 |
| 2 | 52.8 | 65 |
| 3 | 64.8 | 80 |
| 4 | 76.8 | 95 |
| 5 | 88.8 | 110 |
| 6 | 100.8 | 125 |
| 7 | 112.8 | 140 |

_Assumptions: maximum uptime utilizing burst, Oz is the trigger for all 10/12 attacks, and the reactions that occur hit all enemies for 12/15 reactions per minute._

{% tab title="Team Comps" %}
**Units in a Turbo Team**

* Fischl
* Aura Setter
    * Cryo Unit for Superconduct Turbo
    * Pyro Unit for Overload Turbo
* Last two slots are flexible
    * Although for Superconduct Turbo, a secondary cryo unit may be required to maintain cryo aura

**Pyro Aura**

* Xiangling
* Klee

**Cryo Aura**

* Kaeya + Chongyun
* Kaeya + Diona
* Kaeya + Rosaria

**Flex Slot**

Any unit fits here, but the units that benefit most from Turbo are energy-hungry units. Since turbo allows team compositions to capitalize on turbo's obscene energy generation by running **Beidou**, **Xiangling**, and/or **Xingqiu** on more offense-oriented stats over energy recharge.

**Important:** Always use the Aura Setter's burst before deploying Oz in your rotations, the opposite may yield electro aura and not generate turbo energy.

**Additional Notes:**

* When using a character with the same element as the current aura you will not be able to utilize Fischl's A4 since the on-field character will not be the trigger.

**Hotpot**  
Hotpot is a team comp revolving around the concept of using 4 different elements \(Pyro/Hydro/Electro/Cryo\) and turboing,
