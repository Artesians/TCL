## Energy Recharge does NOT have a softcap at least up to 300 ER

By: muakasan/#2792

Evidence: 
I gave my bennet 300.1% ER and funneled off field, different element particles to him. 
It took 33 particles which is almost exactly what should be expected. 0.6 x 3.001 x 33 = 59.420

Significance: 
Helpful when figuring out how much energy recharge is needed to build on a character in a specific team.
