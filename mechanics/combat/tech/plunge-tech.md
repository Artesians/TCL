# Dragon Strike

**Dragon Strike \(DS\)**: Leveraging **anything** that generates sufficient hitlag to do the following \(at the precise moment of impact\):

* DashJump \(Dash must be at least 1ms before Jump, though to most people this will feel like it's at the same time, but dash MUST be first\)
* Plunge attack 

When successful, the DashJump will cause you to gain additional vertical clearance which is a requirement for the plunge attack. Only Claymore users can reliably perform this because of their excessive hitlag. Any unit that generates sufficient hitlag can perform a Dragon Strike, but the window for inputs will be tighter.

Any source of movement speed boost will extend the window for inputs. This includes Diona shield, Anemo resonance, Jean C2, and some weapon effects. To replicate it, the sequence of events is: Hitlag generating action &gt; Hitlag occurring &gt; \(Dash &gt; Jump\) &gt; Plunge.

Please note that this tech is easiest to perform on Claymore users. It is possible to execute on 1H Sword and Polearm users, but difficult to do so. It is also possible to perform Dragon Strike with any cast of Diluc's E, **Searing Onslaught,** with the first and third cast having extremely forgiving windows as well as Beidou's E, **Tidecaller**.

_Popularized by the name Dragon Strike, players were unfamiliar with the original form derived from the japanese pronunciation: Dougragon Strike, or DougStrike for short. - HailCorporate\#2970_

# Stepstool  

It's possible to use hitbox collision off of enemies to push yourself higher which allows average and tall height characters to perform a plunge attack.  

# Switch Plunge

Depending on your ping, it is possible to gain height by jumping right before a character switch occurs, allowing the entering character to jump again and plunge.
