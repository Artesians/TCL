# Glide Cancel

Also called Wavedashing/Wave Dashing.

While in a wind current (either Overword's natural current, or Venti holding Elemental Skill), you can jump, glide, and land instantly.

This is done by jumping, then pressing jump again exactly 4 frames later at 60 fps, or 2 frames later at 30 fps.

A similar technique can also be done at the edge of buildings and Geo constructs, such as Zhongli and Albedo skill.
