description: Aimed R-Cancel Charged Shot (ARCC)

# How to ARCC

First, enter aim mode via aim toggle (R on PC, aim button on Mobile, L2/LT/ZL on Controller).  
* PC and Mobile: Tap the Aim key (R) on the same frame you release Attack (M1).
* Controller: Release both the Aim button and the Attack button on the same frame.

ARCC is easier to do at 30 fps, as the frame window lengths are longer.  

ARCC shots have some quirks that are different from normal Charged Attacks:  
* When out of Normal Attack range from the target, ARCC shots have a fixed height, regardless of how high or low the player aims.
* When within Normal Attack range of a target, ARCC shots will fire toward the target.
* Non-C6 Ganyu, Yoimiya, and Aloy CANNOT fire a fully-charged ARCC shot. They will always get a physical charged shot, regardless of charge level before release.
* C6 Ganyu can fire a fully-charged ARCC after using her skill.

# Hold M1 Double Shot

Some characters are able to fire a second Charged Attack after doing hold M1 CA shot. This second shot has the same properties as ARCC shots.

The sequence to perform this tech is:
* Hold M1
* Release M1 (fires the first CA)
* Hold M1 again before the camera zooms out
* Release M1 at the exact same time the camera begins to zoom out (fires the second CA)
