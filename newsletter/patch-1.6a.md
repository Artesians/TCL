# Patch 1.6a

With patch 1.6 came the eagerly awaited Elemental Mastery buffs and updated Abyss floors. Only to the dismay of all Keqing Mains when Electro reactions remained relatively unchanged, and the era of Anemo Impact rolled in.

Many thanks to both the Theorycrafters at KQM and Twitch Chat for helping the KQM Editor Team get the updated EM formula up on the Theorycrafting Library so quickly after patch 1.6 dropped. 

The updated formula can be seen here:

We have also onboarded quite a few new interns to help clear out the ticket wall once and for all, especially with the massive content bomb of Inazuma looming on the horizon. Look forward to finally seeing the long awaited collapse of the ticket wall soon!
