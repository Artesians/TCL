# Overworld

## Zone Levels:

The overworld map is split into multiple zones that affect enemy level and environmental reactions:

* [Liyue](https://imgur.com/a/8KAMXuE)  
* [Inazuma](https://imgur.com/a/Qmhh5Po)  

## Artifacts

- 4TF and 4CW set bonuses towards Overload and Superconduct do not apply to reactions involving objects or elementally modified terrain such as electrified and frozen water.

## Cursed Terrain 

- The 1.6 EM buffs didn't increase the reaction damage caused by environmental sources, such as electro crystals.
- Overworld entities like grass, water, flowers, and crystals have levels, and do damage depending on those levels.
  - Flower stamens deal damage based on a static, pre-determined level assigned to them.
  - Grass levels are dynamic and change under currently unknown circumstances.

### Electro Crystals

- The area in which an electro crystal can zap a player is [rectangular, with the crystal positioned off-center](./overworld.md#electro-crystal-range).
- Electro crystals near a beach/water seem to have a special electric field with many irregular properties.

### Water

- Water in Genshin exists only in horizontal, 2-dimensional sheets.
- True water, water that can be reacted with, is not graphically represented at all times, additionally, graphically represented water is only an approximation.
- Genshin's water is coded in a way where the visual water and actual layer are separate, thus there is an invisible field of water that does not apply wet in random places of the world, but can be infused.
- Applying electro to water does not produce electro-charged, instead it creates an instance of Electrified.  
  - Some fountains and pools of water cannot create an instance of Electrified.
- Overworld water applies hydro with an ICD of 0.25 seconds, a strength of 10 durability per tick, up to a max of 50, and a duration of 8 seconds, regardless of durability.

### Rain  

- Overworld rain applies hydro with an ICD of 0.5 seconds, and a strength of 10 durability per tick, up to a max of 30. The duration of hydro aura applied by rain is currently unknown.  
- It is unknown if normal rain and thunderstorm rain have the same properties.  

### Electrified  

- Electrified is an electro+hydro reaction that can only be triggered with the useage of overworld water.  
- Electrified tick count scales with electro gauge strength applied.  
- Electrified is a harmful reaction against both player and enemy.  
- Electrified's damage is classified as transformative, but it works off of environment bases.  

## Burning Grass
Overworld grass generally takes 2 units of pyro to ignite. However, some abilities do not interact with grass.\
Burning grass has standard ICD - 3 hits/2.5 seconds. 

## Campfires
Lit campfires essentially have a 1U aura of pyro  that don't decay over time.

Consuming the campfire aura requires one of the following:
* One 1U application of Hydro or Electro
* Two 1U applications of Cryo, Anemo, or Geo
* One 2U (or higher) application of Cryo, Anemo, or Geo

The aura on the campfire is 1U, regardless of the Pyro aura applied.  
For example: Bennett's tap E, which applies 2U of Pyro, still creates a campfire that behaves the exact same as one lit with 1U of pyro.

## Bushes
* Elemental applications can be used to destroy or/and damage bushes. However not all elements are equal in this regard.
* Bushes take one unit of pyro elemental application to light on fire.

## Structures Aren't Considered Enemies

Structures do not count as "opponents" for the purposes of triggering abilities like Albedo's Elemental Skill.

## Coordinates

* Coordinates from in-game could be translated into the Official Teyvat Interactive Map and vice versa for easier navigation.
* Character coordinates change whenever the game state is not frozen (unpaused single player).

## Other world maps  
The current world state & character position is saved between different world maps.  

## Revive Mechanics  

* The game will revives the player's party at 35% Max HP when all party members die.
* The revival happens at the closest Teleport Waypoint, Domain, or Statue of The Seven relative to where the last member died.
* Drowning or falling into the void only removes 10% of Max HP during revival.

## Chests

### Treasure Compass Range

* Treasure Compass detection depends on the chest rendering. Chest rendering suffers from an ItDependsâ„¢ .
* Chest rendering seems to be square, off-set from chest, 360m x 360m for some while 180m x 180m for others.

## 0 Gauge Pyro
* You can light torches and melt Ice Flowers with 0 gauge pyro hits, such as Overload, Hu Tao's Skill cast, and Yoimiya's Skill cast.

## No Raining in Mondstadt
* If it's raining and you approach Mondstadt, the rain will stop, even though the rain will continue outside Mondstadt.

## Boat Mechanics Addendum   
General:  
* Waverider level is determined by world level.
* The Waverider has 0 def and 0 elemental resistances.
* Waverider heals 0.65% when the player is outside of it, and 5% when inside and not in combat. Percentages are in terms of waverider max HP.

Waverider-Terrain interactions:
* When the waverider is in water that is too shallow for it, it slowly drifts towards deeper water.
* When you try to go over a waterfall, you either get stuck if the water is too shallow... or the boat deconstructs.

Waverider vs environment:
* Waverider can be hit by lightning (possibly only in shallow water)
* Waverider takes EC damage if player is in the boat.
* Waverider takes damage from the environment, such as electro crystals and cryo mistflowers. The player needs to be in the boat.
* Waverider is not affected by balethunder or "spicy water".

Waverider vs player:
- Waverider cannot be CC'd with Anemo attacks such as Jean's or Venti's E.
- Waverider can be slightly shifted with Geo MC's E.
- You cannot raise the boat with Albedo E.
- You cannot place Zhongli steles near the boat.
- There's a zone around the waverider where the water can't be frozen.
- If you use the waverider TP to summon the waverider when the "destination" is frozen, it deconstructs

Misc:
- Waverider is not affected by corrosion. If a character is affected by corrosion and enters the boat, HP does not continue to decay, but the duration of the corrosion effect still ticks.
